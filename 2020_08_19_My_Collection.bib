abstract = {The dynamic behaviour of railway bridges in high-speed lines has been the subject of several studies in recent years. Nevertheless, most of the work was developed assuming a deterministic perspective. In this paper a probabilistic approach is used to analyse the sensitivity of the dynamic response of a small span bridge due to the variability of the main structural parameters. A filler beam railway bridge was selected as case study and random variables were identified. A variable screening procedure was performed in order to determine which variables had a higher influence on the dynamic response of the bridge. Simulation techniques were applied to analyse the variability of the dynamic response of the bridge, as these methods allow an accurate consideration of the randomness of the main structural parameters. Based on the simulation results, a traffic safety assessment of the bridge was performed. As conclusion, the safety assessment results are discussed, with special focus on the comparison between the results obtained when adopting the European standards approach and when considering a probabilistic approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {There are plentiful masonry arch bridges around the world that have been used as railway bridges for more than 80 years. In Iran's railway network, 3,700 bridges exist which all of these have been designed based on service load in the past (low-speed trains) and are still serving for trains at a maximum speed of 100 km/h. In the present study, two plain concrete arch bridges are investigated using finite element technique. For validation of numerical models, the crown deflection of the two bridges under static loading and the locomotive moving as well as the first three modes of the bridges were selected as a calibration criterion and compared with experimental results. In the second step, by categorizing the trains based on geometrical properties, 27 models of Asian and European high-speed trains and Euro-code suggestions have been detected to make sure all of the possible geometries have been counted. Afterward, 324 time-history dynamic analyses have been performed in order to assess the dynamic behavior of the bridges under the high-speed trains at speeds of 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 km/h. Finally, deflection and acceleration responses of the bridges for all 324 dynamic analyses at the main crown of the bridges have been extracted. The results indicate that the dynamic performance of these bridges under high-speed trains is affected by span length, vehicle motion speed, material stiffness, train coach distribution, and axles' distances. The responses are increased by increasing the vehicle speed and the spacing of axles in bogies. In the case of acceleration and displacement responses, the effect of span length parameter appeared to be significant at every speed. The results achieved from the time-history analyses showed more sensitivity in the dynamic performance of the bridge with longer span length (2L20) to acceleration response and in the bridge with lower span length (5L06) to displacement response.},

abstract = {A probabilistic methodology for the safety assessment of short span railway bridges for high-speed traffic is presented. The purpose is to create a simple, efficient and automatic procedure that allows identifying the critical train speeds over the bridge and assessing the safety of the train-bridge system. The methodology combines simulation techniques with the extreme value theory in order to minimise the required computational time and guarantee accurate results. Stochastic simulation is employed as it allows reflecting the real variability of the parameters that characterise the dynamic response of the train-bridge system. As a case study the safety of a short span filler beam railway bridge crossed by a TGV double train is assessed. The behaviour of short span railway bridges is known to be particularly difficult to predict due to the complexity of the coupled train-track-bridge system, as well as for being particularly sensitive to resonant phenomena. The variability of the bridge, the track and the train was accounted for, as well as the existence of track irregularities. The proposed probabilistic methodology proved to be efficient as it allowed identifying the critical train speeds with a reduced computational cost. Furthermore, for these critical train speeds two different methods were used to estimate the probability of failure. The obtained results showed a good agreement guaranteeing the accuracy of the methodology. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The use of the dynamic load factor (DLF) to account for the impact effect has been widely accepted in bridge engineering. Although the field monitoring studies are the most dependable way to study the actual DLF of the bridge, according to previous studies there are few field monitoring data on high-speed railway truss arch bridges. This paper presents an evaluation of DLF based on field monitoring and finite element simulation of Nanjing DaShengGuan Bridge, which is a high-speed railway truss arch bridge with the longest span throughout the world. The DLFs in different members of steel truss arch are measured using monitoring data and simulated using finite element model, respectively. The effects of lane position, number of train carriages, and speed of trains on DLF are further investigated. By using the accumulative probability function of the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution, the probability distribution model of DLF is proposed, based on which the standard value of DLF within 50-year return period is evaluated and compared with different bridge design codes.},

The validation of the applicability of the finite element method in this study is conducted by comparing with experiment in terms of mode shape and frequency and with ambient test according to the similarity relation. The effects of number and initial tension force of cable on the dynamic behavior of the model bridge are examined by using the testing method, while the effects of oblique angle of main arch, wind bearing and stringer's stiffness are analyzed in detail using the analytical method. The results indicate that the cable-arch bridge has a better dynamic behavior in lower vertical and torsional modes than pure arch bridges, which would be beneficial to the main span enlargement of cable-arch bridges. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The methods compared are reduced to a unified form, revealing far-reaching similarities between the methods of calculating displacement and velocity. Analogies are found between the recurrence formulas relating the displacement and velocity vectors in different methods. It is proved that these analogies allow for a comparative analysis of the convergence of the three methods and confine it to an analysis of the approximation of the initial conditions and the external loads. Thirteen methods of approximation of the initial conditions are discussed. A new formulation of the space-time finite element is given. The comparative analysis of the convergence is limited to the free oscillations of a system with a single degree of freedom.},

abstract = {Operational modal analysis (OMA) aims at identifying structural modal properties with (output-only) ambient vibration data. In the absence of loading information, the identification (ID) uncertainty of modal properties becomes a valid concern in quality control and test planning. One recent development that addresses this aspect is ‘uncertainty law', which aims at understanding how ID uncertainty depends on test configuration. Mathematically, uncertainty laws in OMA are asymptotic expressions for the ‘posterior' (i.e., given data) variance of modal parameters. Analogous to the laws of large numbers in statistics, they are often derived assuming long data, small damping, and high signal-to-noise ratio. Following a Bayesian approach, this work develops the uncertainty law for OMA with multiple setup data, a common strategy to produce a ‘global' mode shape covering a large number of locations with a small number of sensors in individual setups. It advances over previous results for single setup data, and is motivated by questions, e.g., how does the quality of global mode shape depend on sensor locations and setup schedule? Focusing on the case of fixed reference and distinct rovers, analytical study of the eigenvalue properties of mode shape covariance matrix reveals characteristic spatial patterns where principal uncertainty takes place, which can be of local or global nature. The theory is validated with synthetic, laboratory and field test data. By virtue of the Cramer-Rao bound, up to the same modeling assumptions, the uncertainty law dictates the achievable precision limit of OMA regardless of identification method.},

abstract = {thestructuralengineer.org to the bridge at 2.7m intervals along the bridge form. The loop frame also provides buckling restraint to the spiral steel members. A spiral or helix form is structurally inadequate. It will not span between two supports to carry load and the helix mechanism will untwist when it is loaded. However, two helices can work together to form a bridge when they are run in opposite directions and interconnected by a series of struts and tie rods. As they try to untwist, the rods work in two ways – they connect the two spirals together and, at the same time, keep them separated. This gives structural strength and stiff ness to the bridge, making it a competent structure. The Helix is the fi rst ever example of this structural solution applied to a signifi cant bridge. It represents a design and engineering innovation, and is an entirely new classifi cation of bridge structure. Lateral synchronous vibration One of the main concerns regarding dynamics during the design stage was that of the bridge's susceptibility to lateral synchronous vibration (LSV) – the phenomenon responsible for excessive vibrations felt on London's Millennium Bridge during its opening day 1 . When LSV occurs, pedestrians walking across a bridge progressively lock in step as they attempt to balance themselves laterally. This induces a build-up in vibration on the bridge deck and generates a lock-in phenomenon where the level of vibrations increases with time. Arup has contributed a substantial amount of research on the topic and recommends that the design fundamental frequency for the lateral mode be at least 1.5Hz. The lateral stiff ness of a pile was modelled together with the bridge structure in Strand 7 to take into account the soil–structure interaction eff ects. The stiff ness of the pile would also aff ect the lateral stiff ness of the bridge and hence was considered in the computation of the fundamental frequency for the lateral mode. The soil type surrounding the piles is predominantly marine clay – a very soft clay which has very little stiff ness – which is common for structures around the Marina Bay area. There are upper-bound and lower-bound solutions for the fundamental natural frequency of the lateral mode. The contribution of pile cap stiff ness to the lateral stiff ness of the support was one of the parameters examined. The design team adopted a lower-bound value for the bridge's design. The fundamental frequency for the lateral mode was computed to be 1.76Hz, which is higher than the recommended minimum of 1.5Hz. This meant that LSV would not occur on the Helix Bridge. Subsequently, on-site vibration measurement gave the fundamental frequency for the lateral mode to be 2.52Hz, which is much higher than the predicted frequency of 1.76Hz. The diff erence between predictions and measurement is most probably related to the theoretical presumption of low lateral stiff ness of the pile and pile cap within the very soft clay.},

abstract = {A design methodology to predict optimum post-tensioning forces and dimensioning of the cable system for hybrid cable-stayed suspension (HCS) bridges is proposed. The structural model is based on the combination of an FE approach and an iterative optimization procedure. The former is able to provide a refined description of the bridge structure, which takes into account geometric nonlinearities involved in the bridge components. The latter is utilized to optimize the shape of post-tensioning forces as well as the geometry of the cable system to achieve minimum deflections, lowest steel quantity involved in the cable system and maximum performance of the cables under live load configurations. Results are proposed in terms of comparisons with existing formulations to validate the proposed methodology. Moreover, parametric studies on more complex long span structures are also developed to verify existing cable-dimensioning rules and to analyze between HCS bridges and conventional cable-stayed or suspension systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of innovative bridge solutions are needed in order to keep time and costs at a reasonable level, maintaining at the same time an high level of structural safety and functionality. The network arch bridge solution completely respond to these requirements, and in addition could be designed as a very pleasant and formally elegant structure, because of its slenderness and lightness. In this paper, an introduction on the network arch solution is presented, together with structural analysis and data of relevant structures realized. Furthermore, an optimization of specific types of road and railway bridges is presented in the particular case of hollow sections, considering three alternative of cable disposition.},

The partial correlation is generally interpreted as the correlation that would result if the variables to be eliminated were fixed (not allowed to vary and influence the other variables), which is referred to in the statistical literature as conditional correlation. The present paper demonstrates, by means of theoretical derivations and practical examples, that when the assumption of multivariate normality is violated (e.g., as a result of nonlinear relationships among the variables investigated) the usual interpretation of the partial correlation coefficient will be basically incorrect. In extreme cases the value of the partial correlation coefficient may be strongly positive, close to 1, whereas the conditional correlation may have a large negative value. To solve this problem the paper suggests to partial out a certain function (in most cases the square) of the variables whose effects are to be eliminated if nonlinear relationships are likely to occur. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In contrast to tied arch bridges with vertical hangers, in network arches without hanger relaxation, the line of thrust lies within the arch for all load cases. Therefore, the arch shape does not have to be adapted to a special load case and may be asymmetric. In order to design an asymmetric network arch, a hanger arrangement that prevents hanger relaxation has to be found. Internal forces and technical feasibility are basically the same as in symmetric network arches. Possible applications are asymmetric bridge locations, skew bridges or bridges with variable width. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {Experimental modal analysis (EMA) is basically a procedure of “experimental modeling.” The primary purpose here is to develop a dynamic model for a mechanical system, using experimental data. In this sense, EMA is similar to “model identi?cation” in control system practice, and may utilize somewhat related techniques of “parameter estimation.” It is the nature of the developed model, which may distinguish EMA from other conventional procedures of model identi?cation. Speci?cally, EMA produces a modal model as the primary result, which consists of: 1. Natural frequencies 2. Modal damping ratios 3. Mode shape vectors Once amodalmodel is known, standard results ofmodal analysismaybeused to extract an inertia (mass) matrix, a damping matrix, and a stiffness matrix, which constitute a complete dynamic model for the experimental system, in the time domain. Since EMA produces a modal model (and in some cases a complete time-domaindynamicmodel) for amechanical system fromtest data of the system, its uses canbe extensive. In particular, EMA is useful in mechanical systems, primarily with regard to vibration, in: 1. Design 2. Diagnosis 3. Control In the area of design, the following three approaches that utilize EMA should be mentioned: 1. Component modi?cation 2. Modal response speci?cation 3. Substructuring In component modi?cation, we modify (i.e., add, remove, or vary) inertia (mass), stiffness, and damping parameters in a mechanical system and determine the resulting effect on the modal response (natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes) of the system. In modal response speci?cation, we establish the best changes, from the design point of view, in system parameters (inertia, stiffness, and damping values and their degrees of freedom (DoF), in order to give a “speci?ed” (prescribed) change in the modal response. In substructuring, two or more subsystem models are combined using dynamic interfacing components, and the overall model is determined. Some of the subsystem models used in this manner can be of analytical origin (e.g., ?nite element models).},

Such a problem generally yields a challenging multivariate inverse problem to be solved in high dimension. The high-dimensionality requires the use of a global optimization algorithm in order the explore efficiently the parameters space. In this paper we propose an alternative algorithm which allows each model parameters to be identified separately and sequentially by solving separated univariate inverse problems. For each parameter, a devoted inverse problem is introduced by identifying an output which is sensitive to this parameter only, the sensitivity being quantified using Sobol indices. The proposed method is illustrated through a three-storey structure for which experimental measurements are collected.},

abstract = {Numerical models of large civil engineering structures are prone to errors and uncertain system parameters, which inevitably affect the ability of such models to accurately predict dynamic behavior. Finite element (FE) model updating can be used to calibrate the numerical models towards the observed behavior. In this paper, a case study of the sensitivity method in FE model updating is presented. The methodology is applied to the Bergs{\o}ysund Bridge, which is a long-span floating pontoon bridge in Norway. A system identification is performed based on acceleration data and thirty vibration modes are identified. The FE model is calibrated by reducing the difference between the identified and numerical natural frequencies and mode shapes of the bridge. The model uncertainties are parametrized with a total of 27 parameters. We demonstrate how an analytical sensitivity matrix can be constructed for floating structures, where the system mass and damping matrices are functions of frequency due to fluid-structure interaction. After updating, the mean error in natural frequencies is decreased from 3.23{\%} to 2.34{\%}, and the average MAC number is increased from 0.87 to 0.94. Although the largest errors are significantly reduced, the updated parameters are believed to be affected by noise from the system identification. Challenges related to the presence of very closely spaced vibration modes are also shown, in which matching the identified modes to the modeled modes becomes difficult. This study indicates that models of large bridges can be significantly improved, but many practical issues still exist.},

abstract = {The use of changes in dynamic system characteristics to detect damage has received considerable attention during the last years. Within this context, FE model updating technique, which belongs to the class of inverse problems in classical mechanics, is used to detect, locate and quantify damage. In this study, a sensitivity-based finite element (FE) model updating scheme using a trust region algorithm is developed and implemented in a complex structure. A damage scenario is applied on the structure in which the stiffness values of the beam elements close to the beam-column joints are decreased by stiffness reduction factors. A worst case and complex damage pattern is assumed such that the stiffnesses of adjacent elements are decreased by substantially different stiffness reduction factors. The objective of the model updating is to minimize the differences between the eigenfrequency and eigenmodes residuals. The updating parameters of the structure are the stiffness reduction factors. The changes of these parameters are determined iteratively by solving a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The FE model updating algorithm is also tested in the presence of two levels of noise in simulated measurements. In all three cases, the updated MAC values are above 99{\%} and the relative eigenfrequency differences improve substantially after model updating. In cases without noise and with moderate levels of noise; detection, localization and quantification of damage are successfully accomplished. In the case with substantially noisy measurements, detection and localization of damage are successfully realized. Damage quantification is also promising in the presence of high noise as the algorithm can still predict 18 out of 24 damage parameters relatively accurately in that case. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The safety of the 610 m Guangzhou New Television Tower, due to become China's tallest structure on completion, is an issue that concerns many parties because of the lack of sufficient experience, official design codes, and construction guidelines for such a skyscraper. This article investigates the strain/stress development of this supertall structure through the integration of finite element analysis and field monitoring during the construction stage with a particular focus on the following issues: (1) the shrinkage and creep properties of high-strength low-shrinkage concrete; (2) the strain response of the structure to extreme events including typhoons, a major earthquake, and unfavorable construction loads; and (3) the stress evolution of the supertall structure as construction activity progresses. Field monitoring results demonstrate that the strain responses of the structure to natural hazards are within safe ranges. Finite element model predictions made at different stages of construction are in good agreement with measurement data. The monitoring exercise described in this article provides the designer, the contractor, and the client valuable data regarding the safety of the tower. It verifies the effectiveness and importance of monitoring during the construction phase for such a complex supertall structure. {\textcopyright} 2011 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

abstract = {Component mode synthesis (CMS) method is developed and applied to the element-by-element model updating of large-scale structures in this study. Several lowest frequencies and mode shapes of the global structure are obtained with the free interface CMS method by employing the several lowest frequencies and mode shapes of each substructure individually. In this process, the removal of higher modes is compensated by the residual modes. The eigensensitivity of the global structure is then assembled from the eigensensitivities of each substructure to the updating element parameters. Subsequently, the global model is updated using the sensitivity-based optimization technique. The application of the present method to an 11-floor frame structure and to a large-scale structure demonstrates its accuracy and efficiency. The computational time required by the substructuring method to calculate the eigensensitivity matrices is significantly reduced, as compared with that consumed by the conventional global-based approach. Selection of the number of master modes is also proposed.},

@article{Zivanovic2007a,
abstract = {The finite element (FE) model updating technology was originally developed in the aerospace and mechanical engineering disciplines to automatically update numerical models of structures to match their experimentally measured counterparts. The process of updating identifies the drawbacks in the FE modelling and the updated FE model could be used to produce more reliable results in further dynamic analysis. In the last decade, the updating technology has been introduced into civil structural engineering. It can serve as an advanced tool for getting reliable modal properties of large structures. The updating process has four key phases: initial FE modelling, modal testing, manual model tuning and automatic updating (conducted using specialist software). However, the published literature does not connect well these phases, although this is crucial when implementing the updating technology. This paper therefore aims to clarify the importance of this linking and to describe the complete model updating process as applicable in civil structural engineering. The complete process consisting the four phases is outlined and brief theory is presented as appropriate. Then, the procedure is implemented on a lively steel box girder footbridge. It was found that even a very detailed initial FE model underestimated the natural frequencies of all seven experimentally identified modes of vibration, with the maximum error being almost 30{\%}. Manual FE model tuning by trial and error found that flexible supports in the longitudinal direction should be introduced at the girder ends to improve correlation between the measured and FE-calculated modes. This significantly reduced the maximum frequency error to only 4{\%}. It was demonstrated that only then could the FE model be automatically updated in a meaningful way. The automatic updating was successfully conducted by updating 22 uncertain structural parameters. Finally, a physical interpretation of all parameter changes is discussed. This interpretation is often missing in the published literature. It was found that the composite slabs were less stiff than originally assumed and that the asphalt layer contributed considerably to the deck stiffness. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that the natural frequency decreased and the modal damping ratio increased with increasing amplitudes of vibration. This paper illustrates the influence of these variations on the train-bridge resonance of this particular bridge by means of a non-linear single degree of freedom system, based on the previously mentioned experimental results. As one might expect, the results indicate that the influence of the increasing damping ratio leads to a considerable decrease in the resonant amplitude whilst the decreasing natural frequency decreases the critical train speed at which resonance occurs. Further studies along this line of research may help us reduce the uncertainties in dynamic assessments of existing bridges based on dynamic measurements and improve our understanding of the dynamic properties of railway bridges in general. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The second is to show the capabilities of a three-dimensional boundary element method (BEM)/finite element method (FEM) numerical approach for the analysis of train induced vibrations. The model can represent local soil conditions, discontinuities such as underpasses, as well as structures placed next to the rail track. Vibrations in those structures can be computed taking into account, in a rigorous way, dynamic soil-structure interaction and local soil properties. Experimental and numerical results at several points near the track are compared. Results for an overhead contact support structure are also evaluated. The comparison of numerically predicted and recorded results shows that the model is reliable for predicting the amplitude of vibrations produced in the soil and nearby structures by high-speed trains. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The work presented in this thesis studies the load and load effects of traffic loads on railway bridges. The increased knowledge of the traffic loads, simulated using field measurements of actual trains, are employed in a reliability analysis in an attempt at upgrading existing railway bridges. The study utilises data from a weigh-in-motion site which records, for each train, the train speed, the loads from each axle and the axle spacings. This data of actual train configurations and axle loads are portrayed as moving forces and then used in computer simulations of trains crossing two dimensional simply supported bridges at constant speed. Only single track short to medium span bridges are considered in the thesis. The studied load effect is the moment at mid-span. From the computer simulations the moment history at mid-span is obtained. The load effects are analysed by two methods, the first is the classical extreme value theory where the load effect is modelled by the family of distributions called the generalised extreme value distribution (GEV). The other method adopts the peaks-over-threshold method (POT) where the limiting family of distributions for the heights to peaks-over-threshold is the Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD). The two models are generally found to be a good representation of the data. The load effects modelled by either the GEV or the GPD are then incorporated into a reliability analysis in order to study the possibility of raising allowable axle loads on existing Swedish railway bridges. The results of the reliability analysis show that they are sensitive to the estimation of the shape parameter of the GEV or the GPD. While the study is limited to the case of the ultimate limit state where the effects of fatigue are not accounted for, the findings show that for the studied cases an increase in allowable axle load to 25 tonnes would be acceptable even for bridges built to the standards of 1940 and designed to Load Model A of that standard. Even an increase to both 27.5 and 30 tonnes appears to be possible for certain cases. It is also observed that the short span bridges of approximately four metres are the most susceptible to a proposed increase in permissible axle load.},

abstract = {Modern regulations concerning railway bridges are based on the approach of structural dynamics, which is described in PN-EN standards. This paper presents the results of theoretical dynamic analysis of the HSLM-A train set loading on the structure of a pre-stressed concrete arch bridge - the first railway bridge of its type which was built in Poland (completed in 1959). The recommendations of PN-EN have been followed and modal analysis was carried out to define the sensitivity of the structure to chosen eigenforms. Additionally the paper presents a course of calculations and the conclusions obtained from the analysis of displacements, accelerations, and bending moments induced in the structure through a simulated passage of a high-speed train in the context of the requirements of PN-EN Standards. The conclusions from the current calculations can be used for dynamic analysis of bridges of similar structural solutions.},

A brief review of the techniques for operational modal testing and identification is presented, and it is argued, that there is now a wide range of techniques for effective identification of modal parameters of practical interest – including the mode shape scaling factor – with a high degree of accuracy. It is also argued that the operational technology offers the user a number of advantages over traditional modal testing. The operational modal technology allows the user to perform a modal analysis in an easier way and in many cases more effectively than traditional modal analysis methods. It can be applied for modal testing and analysis on a wide range of structures and not only for problems generally investigated using traditional modal analysis, but also for those requiring load estimation, vibration level estimation and fatigue analysis.},

abstract = {A vehicle-bridge tuned mass damper (TMD) coupled dynamic analysis and vibration-control model was established to optimize TMD damping effects on a steel-box girder bridge bearing vehicle loads. It was also used to investigate optimization efficiency of different algorithms in TMD design parameters. This model simulated bridges and vehicles with the use of a 7 degrees of freedom curved-beam element model and a 7 degrees of freedom vehicle model, respectively. The TMD system was simulated with the use of multiple rigid-body systems linked with springs and dampers. Road surface condition, as a vibration source, was simulated with the use of a frequency equivalent method based on a power spectrum. A variably-accelerated pattern search algorithm was proposed in line with the initial TMD parameters calculated by Den Hartog formula. Visual software was compiled by Fortran and used for an optimization study of vibration reduction. A three-span, curved, continuous steel-box girder bridge was used as the numerical example. Optimized effects and computational efficiency of vibration reduction under different methods were compared. The comparison included a single variable optimization based on Den Hartog formula, an ergodic search method, an integer programming method, a traditional genetic algorithm, a traditional pattern search algorithm, and a variably-accelerated pattern search algorithm. The results indicate that variably-accelerated pattern search algorithm is more efficient at improving TMD optimal parameter design. Final TMD parameter optimization values obtained by different methods are quite close to each other and tends verify the reliability of the optimization results.},

abstract = {Trains at speeds above 200 km/h may induce resonance in bridges or viaducts. This fact implies the necessity of sufficiently detailed dynamic calculations, which has been included in the latest engineering codes of practise (FS 1997; prEN 1991-2 2002; IAPF 2001). Various mathematical models are available for dynamic analysis of trains of moving loads, generally through direct time integration of the equations of motion. Some simplified analytical methods are also available (ERRI D214 (a) 1998) which provide directly dynamic envelopes. However, these methods are only valid for simply- supported beams. In some cases it may be necessary to employ complex models with vehicle-bridge interaction. In this paper we discuss the applicability of the above methods for calculation of railway bridges. Following, two practical studies applying the above techniques are presented. For portal frame underpasses, a simplified method of calculation is justified which may greatly simplify engineering calculations. Finally, we also present results of a study evaluating the relative reduction in dynamic effects which may be obtained by considering vehicle-bridge interaction.},

abstract = {Railway induced vibrations on short-to-medium span simply-supported (SS) bridges is addressed in this contribution. Such structures may experience high levels of vertical acceleration at the platform, leading to adverse consequences such as a premature degradation of the ballast layer and passenger discomfort. In the present study, the evolution of the bridge dynamic response when soil-structure interaction (SSI) is taken into account is investigated. To this end a coupled three-dimensional (3D) Boundary Element-Finite Element model (BEM-FEM) formulated in the time domain is implemented to reproduce the soil and structural behaviour, respectively. First, a set of soil-bridge systems of interest is defined, covering a wide range of lengths and natural frequencies for the structures, and an interval of expectable elastic properties and damping levels for the soil. Then, different types of analyses are performed on the soil-bridge systems extracting conclusions regarding the effect of including SSI in numerical models for predicting the bridge behaviour under railway traffic. In particular natural frequencies and modal damping levels are identified, and the structure amplification after the passage of a moving load in free vibration is investigated. Conclusions regarding how resonance and cancellation conditions may be affected by soil properties are extracted. Finally, the dynamic response of a real bridge, belonging to the Spanish railway network, is evaluated under the circulation of trains that induce second and third resonances of the bridge fundamental mode. The effect of the soil flexibility, soil material damping and the bridge resonance order are evaluated. Conclusions regarding the appropriateness of the results provided by common models which do not include SSI effects are extracted.},

Bridges and viaducts for high speed trains are subject to demanding dynamic loads, as to the classical effect of the moving (single) load the dynamic resonance appears for speeds above 220 km/h. The classical methods for evaluation of dynamic impact factors available in engineering, reflected in the codes of practise existing until recently, do not cover this possibility of resonance. The design of such structures requires dynamic calculations which are the object of this paper. In it we cover a general revision of available methods for calculation, as well as a description of the provisions in the new (draft) codes IAPF [13] and Eurocode 1 for actions on bridges [22]. Additionally, some recent research results obtained by our group are presented for high speed traffic loads on bridges. The object of these studies is diverse: sensitivity to integration time-step in modal analysis, simplified torsion analysis, evaluation of the bridge-vehicle interaction in isostatic bridges and a proposal of a simplified method for dynamic analysis of portal frames. All of these topics originate from issues in the application of the new regulations for high speed lines, and are oriented toward being of practical use to designers of railway bridges.},

abstract = {The critical speed and hunting frequency are two basic research objects of vehicle system dynamics and have a significant influence on the dynamic performance. A lateral dynamic model with 17 degrees of freedom was established in this study to investigate the critical speed and hunting frequency of a high-speed railway vehicle. The nonlinearities of wheel/rail contact geometry, creep forces, and yaw damper were all considered. A heuristic nonlinear creep model was employed to estimate the contact force between the wheel and the rail. The Maxwell model, which covers the influence of the stiffness characteristic, is used to simulate the yaw damper. To reflect the blow-off of the yaw damper, the damping coefficient is described by stages. Based on the mathematical model, the combined effects of vehicle parameters on the critical speed in the straight line and hunting frequency of the wheelset were investigated innovatively. The novel phenomenon that the hunting frequency exhibits a sudden increase from a smaller value to a larger value when the blow-off of the yaw damper occurs was discovered during the calculations. The extents to which various parameters affect the critical speed and hunting frequency are clear on the basis of the numerical results. Moreover, all of the parameter values were divided into three sections to determine the sensitive range for the critical speed and hunting frequency. The results show that the first section of values plays the decisive role on both the critical speed and the hunting frequency for all parameters analyzed. The investigation in this paper enriches the study of hunting stability and gives some ideas to probably solve the abnormal vibrations during the actual operation.},

abstract = {From experience, the control of the dynamic behavior of rail bridges (deflection and acceleration) has proven to be a “since qua non” condition for the control of railway highspeed. Without it, not only the rail-wheel contact might be ruptured when crossing the structures, but above all chances are that instabilities of the ballast railway might appear on and around the bridges and viaducts. The analysis of the behavior of the latter using finite-element software allows avoiding such risks. Yet the use of computerized programs does not truly permit to underline the importance of the parameters that rule the phenomenon. Also, engineers do not have at their disposal all the elements permitting to guarantee a real conception: to understand why and how the structure reacts to the crossing of the trains, to know on which characteristic of the structure one has to work in order to modify its behavior – or simply to foresee the latter (the behavior) in the case of the degradation of one of his characteristics. Even several numerical simulations, may they be long and expensive, do not allow the total understanding of the train/structure interaction. When analyzing the excitation created by a train, it is possible to underline all the parameters that are useful to the control of the dynamic behavior of railway bridges. The method presented in this work and based on the concept of the dynamic signature of trains (or their spectrum) allowed elaborating new regulations that were incorporated into the Eurocodes – in particular the universal dynamic train – as well as interoperability technical specifications (ITS) permitting high-speed trains to travel all over Europe. However, the knowledge of those different regulations is not enough to fully understand the phenomenon; only the process described in the present document permits to obtain such a result.},

abstract = {Wheel flats have become a major problem affecting the long-term service of railway systems. Wheels with flats create intermittent impact loads to trains and rails. This not only accelerates the deterioration of vehicle and track components but also leads to abnormal wheel-rail contact conditions. An effective method for detecting wheel conditions is urgently needed to ensure the operation of the railway and provide guidance for the repair of wheels. However, most previous researches have used qualitative detection methods, and hence have been unable to achieve accurate positioning of the wheel flats. In addition, the theoretical basis for the layout scheme for wheel flat detection sensors is lacking, making it impossible to meet the needs of field applications. In this study, we simulated the spatial distribution characteristics of rail strain, under different wheel flat conditions, and based on this, a layout scheme of multisensor arrays was proposed which more effectively captured the responses of the wheel flats. A wheel flat recognition and precise positioning method based on multisensor fusion was designed. The algorithm was validated through the combination of experimental and simulation methods. The result shows that the algorithm can ideally detect and locate the wheel flats under complex conditions.},

abstract = {Autonomous structural health monitoring (SHM) of a large number of bridges became a topic of paramount importance for maintenance purposes and safety reasons. This article proposes a set of machine learning (ML) tools to perform automatic detection of anomalies in a bridge structure from vibrational data. As a case study, we considered the Z-24 bridge for which an extensive database of accelerometric data is available. The proposed framework starts from the stabilization diagram obtained through operational modal analysis (OMA) to perform the clustering of modal frequencies and their tracking by density-based time-domain filtering. The features extracted are then fed to a one-class classification (OCC) algorithm to perform anomaly detection. In particular, we propose two new anomaly detectors, namely, one-class classifier neural network (OCCNN) and OCCNN2, that find the normal class (the boundary of the features space in normal operating conditions) through a two-step approach: coarse and fine boundary estimate. The detection algorithms are then compared with known methods based on the principal component analysis (PCA), the kernel PCA (KPCA), the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the autoassociative neural network (ANN). The proposed OCCNN solution presents increased accuracy and F1 score over conventional algorithms, without the need to set critical parameters, while OCCNN2 provides the best performance in terms of F1 score, accuracy, and responsiveness.},

abstract = {There are special requirements concerning bridges servicing high-velocity transport. Single track single span railway steel truss viaduct of 93 m theoretical length was tested and numerically analysed. The aim was to assess its applicability to transport of 300/350 km/h velocity and set the basis for its modernization design. The key role played dynamic tests and computations. Their results are presented In the paper. The test and computation results proved that the structure in concern may be adapted to transport of velocity up to 350 km/h. Design computations of modernization should be completed with dynamic analysis under actual loading meant to run on the viaduct.},

Modal Analysis is the processes of determining the inherent dynamic characteristics of any system and using them to formulate a mathematical model of the dynamic behavior of the system. In the past two decades it has become a major technological tool in the quest for determining, improving and optimizing dynamic characteristics of engineering structures. Its main application is in mechanical and aeronautical engineering, but it is also gaining widespread use in civil and structural engineering, biomechanical problems, space structures, acoustic instruments and nuclear engineering.The only book to focus on the theory of modal analysis before discussing applicationsA relatively new technique being utilized more and more in recent years which is now filtering through to undergraduate coursesLeading expert in the field},

It is equipped with a large structural health monitoring (SHM) system which has been collecting the measured data since the bridge opening in the year 2011. This paper presents a comparison between the measured data and the finite element method (FEM) calculations, while taking into account 7 years of data collection and analyses. The first part of this paper concerns the SHM application. In the next part, which contains comparisons between forces in cables and temperature changes throughout the structure, the measured data are presented. The third part includes SHM-based calculations and simulations with a complex FEM model to check the measured data and to estimate future measurements. The last part contains a durability assessment calculation for the cable stays.},

@article{Fonseca1998,
abstract = {In optimization, multiple objectives and constraints cannot be handled independently of the underlying optimizer. Requirements such as continuity and differentiability of the cost surface add yet another conflicting element to the decision process. While "better" solutions should be rated higher than "worse" ones, the resulting cost landscape must also comply with such requirements. Evolutionary algorithms (EA's), which have found application in many areas not amenable to optimization by other methods, possess many characteristics desirable in a multiobjective optimizer, most notably the concerted handling of multiple candidate solutions. However, EA's are essentially unconstrained search techniques which require the assignment of a scalar measure of quality, or fitness, to such candidate solutions. After reviewing current evolutionary approaches to multiobjective and constrained optimization, the paper proposes that fitness assignment be interpreted as, or at least related to, a multicriterion decision process. A suitable decision making framework based on goals and priorities is subsequently formulated in terms of a relational operator, characterized, and shown to encompass a number of simpler decision strategies. Finally, the ranking of an arbitrary number of candidates is considered. The effect of preference changes on the cost surface seen by an EA is illustrated graphically for a simple problem. The paper concludes with the formulation of a multiobjective genetic algorithm based on the proposed decision strategy. Niche formation techniques are used to promote diversity among preferable candidates, and progressive articulation of preferences is shown to be possible as long as the genetic algorithm can recover from abrupt changes in the cost landscape. {\textcopyright} 1998 IEEE.},

In many engineering problems the deformations also have to be calculated, for example in order to avoid inadmissibly large deflections. The bodies must then be considered as being deformable.},

abstract = {Increasing strength of new structural materials and longer spans of new footbridges, accompanied with aesthetic requirements for greater slenderness, are resulting in more lively footbridge structures. In the past few years this issue attracted great public attention. The excessive lateral sway motion caused by crowd walking across the infamous Millennium Bridge in London is the prime example of the vibration serviceability problem of footbridges. In principle, consideration of footbridge vibration serviceability requires a characterisation of the vibration source, path and receiver. This paper is the most comprehensive review published to date of about 200 references which deal with these three key issues.},

Some immune mechanisms, selection, receptor editing and vaccination are introduced into the basic PSO to improve its performance. The objective function for damage detection is based on vibration data, such as natural frequencies and mode shapes. The feasibility and efﬁciency of IEPSO are compared with the basic PSO, a differential evolution algorithm and a real-coded genetic algorithm on two examples. Results show that the proposed strategy is efﬁcient on determining the sites and the extents of structure damages.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a proposal to extend the heuristic called “particle swarm optimization” (PSO) to deal with multiobjective optimization problems. Our approach uses the concept of Pareto dominance to determine the flight direction of a particle and it maintains previously found nondominated vectors in a global repository that is later used by other particles to guide their own flight. The approach is validated using several standard test functions from the specialized literature. Our results indicate that our approach is highly competitive with current evolutionary multiobjective optimization techniques.},

@book{Miettinen1999,
abstract = {A large number of papers devoted to multiobjective optimization is still not well balanced by a sufficient quantity of books which can serve as a reference for the field. Therefore, the monograph by Kaisa Miettinen, a concise (as compared to the extent of the subject), formal, and clearly written text, should be warmly welcomed. It is a presentation of fundamentals and cornerstone developments of multiobjective optimization. It also reports on some of the author's own contributions to the field. $\backslash$par The book is composed of nine chapters. Chapter One presents basic concepts of the theory of multiobjective optimization. Chapter Two lists the major methods available in the field. Each method is briefly described, together with some theoretical results and underlying concepts, applications, extensions. This part can effectively be used as a basis for a postgraduate course. $\backslash$par Chapter Three contains a general description of some of the most popular software packages for solving multiobjective optimization problems. The description is general and does not cover implementation details. In the next chapter, Chapter Four, an important subject is treated, namely methods for graphical visualization of the search process for the final efficient solution among the universe of (efficient) solutions. Chapter Five contains some guidelines on how to select the most suitable method to solve a problem. Results of numerical testing of two selected methods, namely the Geoffrion-Dyer-Feinberg method and the Nimbus method, the latter an original method proposed by the author, are reported in Chapter Six. $\backslash$par The reader can get the flavor of multiobjective optimization applications in Chapter Seven, where two practical problems, the optimal control of elastic spring and the optimal control of a continuous steel casting process, are presented and solved. Some comments (Chapter Eight) on future research directions and general remarks (Chapter Nine) conclude the work. $\backslash$par This useful reference book certainly will find its way to the bookshelves of many, whose interests range from vector optimization (hard mathematics) through decision theory (behavioral sciences) to decision making in the tough world of reality.},

abstract = {This article reviews the using of the original Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC). The Modal Assurance Criterion is a statistical indicator that is most sensitive to large differences and relatively insensitive to small differences in the mode shapes. This yields a good statistic indicator and a degree of consistency between mode shapes. The MAC considers only modal shapes which mean that a separate frequency comparison must be used in conjunction with the MAC values to determine the correlated mode pairs. The MAC is often to used to pair modes shapes derived from analytical models with those obtained experimentally. It is easy to apply and does not require an estimate of the system matrices. It is bounded between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating fully consistent mode shapes. It can only indicate consistency and does not indicate validity or orthogonality. A value near 0 indicates that the modes are not consistent.},

During a retrofit evaluation, analytical models are created to predict the bridge response and damage levels due to seismic loading.

@article{Peeters1999a,
abstract = {When performing vibration tests on civil engineering structures, it is often unpractical and expensive to use artificial excitation (shakers, drop weights). Ambient excitation on the contrary is freely available (traffic, wind), but it causes other challenges. The ambient input remains unknown and the system identification algorithms have to deal with output-only measurements. For instance, realization algorithms can be used: originally formulated for impulse responses they were easily extended to output covariances. More recently, data-driven stochastic subspace algorithms which avoid the computation of the output covariances were developed. The key element of these algorithms is the projection of the row space of the future outputs into the row space of the past outputs. Also typical for ambient testing of large structures is that not all degrees of freedom can be measured at once but that they are divided into several set-ups with overlapping reference sensors. These reference sensors are needed to obtain global mode shapes. In this paper, a novel approach of stochastic subspace identification is presented that incorporates the idea of the reference sensors already in the identification step: the row space of future outputs is projected into the row space of past reference outputs. The algorithm is validated with real vibration data from a steel mast excited by wind load. The price paid for the important gain concerning computational efficiency in the new approach is that the prediction errors for the non-reference channels are higher. The estimates of the eigenfrequencies and damping ratios do not suffer from this fact.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the methodology of the bridge-vehicle dynamic model definition based on the free response measurements of an existing train and existing bridge spans. In the case of the railway vehicle, the methodology uses the impulse excitations of a single car by means of the wedge method. In the case of the bridge spans, free responses are collected after the passages of trains. The global modal parameters (frequencies and modal damping) of both structures are identified using two modal identification techniques, i.e., the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) and the peak picking method (PP). A simplified single-suspension model of the vehicle with 11 global dof's is proposed that can be useful in the bridge-vehicle interaction analysis. Two steel spans having non-ballasted tracks are the bridge structures. Field tests are conducted to identify the modal parameters and validate the numerical models. Finally, numerical simulations of the train passing over the bridges are compared with the in situ measurements performed under operating conditions.},

abstract = {This article presents a study on the capability of the time domain OMA method, NExT-ERA, to identify closely spaced structural dynamic modes. A survey in the literature reveals that few experimental studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of the NExT-ERA methodology in case of closely spaced modes specifically. In this paper we present the formulation for NExT-ERA. This formulation is then implemented in an algorithm and a code, developed in house to identify the modal parameters of different systems using their generated time history data. Some numerical models are firstly investigated to validate the code. Two different case studies involving a plate with closely spaced modes and a pulley ring with greater extent of closeness in repeated modes are presented. Both structures are excited by random impulses under the laboratory condition. The resulting time response acceleration data are then used as input in the developed code to extract modal parameters of the structures. The accuracy of the results is checked against those obtained from experimental tests.},

Stress intensity factors and J-integral approach were validated numerically against closed-form solutions of semi-infinite plates with throughthickness cracks, double-edged cracks, single-edged crack, and cracks growing from round holes. Only a 2 percent difference between the closedform solution and the numerical calculated values was obtained. Additionally, the report shows meshing techniques that facilitated the construction of the complex 3-D model. Finally, results and graphical methods of the parametric analysis to calculate the optimum diagonal prestresses are illustrated.},

The experimental set-up was developed to measure human walking loads on the vibrating deck and the interaction between a walking person and a vibrating structure could be observed. On the basis of experimental results the simple theory of vertical lock in effect was formulated and verified in the experimental way. A simple load function implemented to commercial FEM system allows the simulation of dynamic response of the bridge. Two examples of the theoretical model are compared with the experiment.},

abstract = {During the 1980s the technology of modal testing became very widely practised in all those engineering disciplines where vibration and other dynamic phenomena affect the behaviour and performance of structures and machines. The techniques involved in carrying out a modal test were developed to a high degree of sophistication while the applications to which the results of these tests could be put became more numerous and more powerful. At the same time as the advantages of modal testing were being enjoyed by an increasing audience, some of the drawbacks of inexpert use of the technology were being learned and recorded. These experiences reinforced the need for a thorough understanding of fundamentals upon which modal testing is based, and of the detailed workings of the various phases and processes which make up a successful test. In this book, all the steps involved in planning, executing, interpreting and applying the results from a modal test are described in straightforward terms. Efforts are made throughout to ensure that the reader understands the physics of the various stages as well as (if not before) the mathematics. This edition has brought the previous book up to date by including all the new and improved techniques which have emerged during the 15 years since the first edition was written. The more powerful applications are developed in more detail than previously and some new topics have been introduced, notable amongst which are the application of modal testing to rotating machinery and the use of the scanning laser vibrometer.},

abstract = {The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains 236 lock chambers at 191 lock sites on 41 waterways throughout the contiguous United States. Waterway navigational locks are important parts of the nation's infrastructure. Locks enable the flow of billions of dollars of commerce and support efforts for flood control. Proper maintenance of the locks and early detection of damage is crucial; however, due to shrinking budgets, adequate funding to apply traditional scheduled maintenance and visual inspection is not available. Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems have been considered to assist in establishing more efficient maintenance, repair, and replacement priorities for navigational locks. This work was undertaken to develop and implement a real-time methodology that provides lock operators with a robust, accurate warning system of gap(s) at the gate-to-wall interface. This initial effort, which focused on horizontally framed miter gates and on damage that is assumed to take the form of a gap at the gate/wall interface (quoin), developed a methodology to identify the occurrence of damage in miter gate structures using data from strain and water level gages that is collected continuously from the SHM system deployed by USACE.},

abstract = {The dynamic effects of high-speed trains on viaducts are important issues for the design of the structures, as well as for the consideration of safe running conditions for the trains. In this work we start by reviewing the relevance of some basic design aspects. The significance of impact factor envelopes for moving loads is considered first. Resonance which may be achieved for high-speed trains requires dynamic analysis, for which some key aspects are discussed. The relevance of performing a longitudinal distribution of axle loads, the number of modes taken in analysis, and the consideration of vehicle-structure interaction are discussed with representative examples. The lateral dynamic effects of running trains on bridges is of importance for laterally compliant viaducts, such as some very tall structures erected in new high-speed lines. The relevance of this study is mainly for the safety of the traffic, considering both internal actions such as the hunting motion as well as external actions such as wind or earthquakes [1]. These studies require three-dimensional dynamic coupled vehicle-bridge models, and consideration of wheel to rail contact, a phenomenon which is complex and costly to model in detail. We describe here a fully nonlinear coupled model, described in absolute coordinates and incorporated into a commercial finite element framework [2]. The wheel-rail contact has been considered using a FastSim algorithm which provides a compromise between accuracy and computational cost, and captures the main nonlinear response of the contact interface. Two applications are presented, firstly to a vehicle subject to a strong wind gust traversing a bridge, showing the relevance of the nonlinear wheel-rail contact model as well as the dynamic interaction between bridge and vehicle. The second application is to a real HS viaduct with a long continuous deck and tall piers and high lateral compliance [3]. The results show the safety of the traffic as well as the importance of considering features such as track alignment irregularities.},

abstract = {Ambient vibration test has gained increasing popularity in practice as it provides an economical means for modal identification without artificial loading. Since the signal-tonoise ratio cannot be directly controlled, the uncertainty associated with the identified modal parameters is a primary concern. From a scientific point of view, it is of interest to know on what factors the uncertainty depends and what the relationship is. For planning or specification purposes, it is desirable to have an assessment of the test configuration required to achieve a specified accuracy in the modal parameters. For example, what is the minimum data duration to achieve a 30{\%} coefficient of variation (c.o.v.) in the damping ratio? To address these questions, this work investigates the leading order behavior of the ‘posterior uncertainties' (i.e., given data) of the modal parameters in a Bayesian identification framework. In the context of well-separated modes, small damping and sufficient data, it is shown rigorously that, among other results, the posterior c.o.v. of the natural frequency and damping ratio are asymptotically equal to ð$\zeta$=2$\pi$NcBf Þ1=2 and 1=ð2$\pi$$\zeta$NcB$\zeta$Þ1=2, respectively; where $\zeta$ is the damping ratio; Nc is the data length as a multiple of the natural period; Bf and B$\zeta$ are data length factors that depend only on the bandwidth utilized for identification, for which explicit expressions have been derived. As the Bayesian approach allows full use of information contained in the data, the results are fundamental characteristics of the ambient modal identification problem. This paper develops the main theory. The companion paper investigates the implication of the results and verification with field test data.},

abstract = {Structures are mainly subjected to various types of loading conditions such as earthquake, wind loads etc. For earthquake zone areas, the structures are designed considering seismic forces. The structure which are present in higher earthquake zone area are liable to get damaged or collapsed, hence to increase the safety of these structure few retrofitting techniques or addition of materials to stabilize the structures against the earthquake forces are done. And if the retrofitting techniques are adopted then cost plays an important role and possibly few spaces will be compromised depend upon the type of methods adopted. Later the structure may be strengthened by adding materials externally to transfer the lateral loads i.e. some protective devices have been developed. In modern seismic design, damping devices are used to reduce the seismic energy and enable the control of the structural response of the structure to that1earthquake excitation. For the present study, an 8-story structure which is symmetrical in plan is modelled and analyzed using the ETABs 2015 software. The earthquake loads are defined as per IS1893-2002 (Part 1). To analyze the structure, the static and dynamic analysis method is adopted. The response spectrum function is defined to carry out dynamic analysis. To control the seismic response and to increase the stiffness of the structure, viscous damper are provided to the structure. The structure with viscous damper is modelled and analyzed with same parameters. The mechanical properties of viscous damper used in this study are as damping coefficient Cd= 810 kN-s/m and exponent as 0.3. The results obtained and compared in the form of displacement, story drift and story shear are compared.},

The results indicate that the CSPD has desirable mechanical properties and hysteretic performance when the geometric design parameters lie within a reasonable range. Then a selected CSPD with reasonable geometric design parameters was installed on the side piers of upper-deck type steel truss arch bridge to explore the resulting improvement in the seismic behaviour of the original arch bridge.

abstract = {The eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) is one of the most popular methods in civil engineering applications for estimating the modal parameters, including complex-valued modal frequencies and modal vectors, of dynamic systems. In dealing with noisy measurement data, the ERA partitions the realized model into principal (signal) and perturbational (noise) portions so that the noise portion can be disregarded. During the separation of signal and noise, a critical issue is the determination for the dimensions of the block Hankel matrix which is built from noisy measurement data. We show that the signal and noise matrices can be better separated when the number of blockrows and number of block-columns of the corresponding block Hankel matrix are chosen to be close to each other. We introduce the concept of using the Frobenius norm (L 2-norm) of the signal and noise matrices to quantify the signal to noise ratio in the global sense (involving multiple signals). We also propose a verification procedure to justify that the estimated modal parameters are noise insensitive and thus indeed associated with the true system. The procedure involves artificially injecting random noise into the measured signals (which are noisy signals) to create noisy-noisy signals, then comparing the identification results obtained respectively from the measured and noisynoisy signals. Using experimental data collected from a test plate, we demonstrate that if signal and noise portions have been properly separated while using the measured data, then the artificial noise would almost completely accumulate to the noise portion. Therefore, the modal estimation based on the signal portion only would remain the same by using either the measured or the noisy-noisy signals.},

abstract = {Vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) for long-span bridges has become a dominant research topic in recent years. The Nam O Railway Bridge is a large-scale steel truss bridge located on the unique main rail track from the north to the south of Vietnam. An extensive vibration measurement campaign and model updating are extremely necessary to build a reliable model for health condition assessment and operational safety management of the bridge. The experimental measurements are carried out under ambient vibrations using piezoelectric sensors, and a finite element (FE) model is created in MATLAB to represent the physical behavior of the structure. By model updating, the discrepancies between the experimental and the numerical results are minimized. For the success of the model updating, the efficiency of the optimization algorithm is essential. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) are employed to update the unknown model parameters. The result shows that PSO not only provides a better accuracy between the numerical model and measurements, but also reduces the computational cost compared to GA. This study focuses on the stiffness conditions of typical joints of truss structures. According to the results, the assumption of semi-rigid joints (using rotational springs) can most accurately represent the dynamic characteristics of the truss bridge considered.},

abstract = {A simple dynamic system composed of two linear oscillators is employed to analyze the passive control performance that can be achieved through a visco-elastic damper connecting two adjacent free-standing structures. By extension, the model may also describe the energy dissipation which can be obtained by an internal coupling between two quasi-independent sub-systems composing a single complex structure. Two alternatives are evaluated for the linear coupling by considering either the serial or the parallel spring–dashpot arrangement known as the Kelvin–Voigt and the Maxwell damper model, which may synthetically reproduce the constitutive behavior of different industrial devices. The complex eigenvalues of the coupled system are parametrically analyzed to determine the potential benefits realized by different combinations of the coupling stiffness and damping coefficient. A design strategy to assess these parameters is outlined, driven by the relevant observation that a perfect tuning of the natural frequencies always corresponds, in the parameter space, to the maximum modal damping for one of the resonant modes, independent of the damper model. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is discussed for different classes of the controlled system, depending on the mass and stiffness ratio of the component oscillators. As a major result, different design parameter charts for the two damper models are carried out and compared to each other. Performance indexes are introduced to quantitatively evaluate the passive control performance with respect to the mitigation of the system forced response under harmonic and seismic ground excitation. The analyses confirm the validity of the design strategy for a well-balanced mitigation of the displacement and acceleration response in both the oscillators.},

The load tests, performed on a 14-m long structure, were the final stage of a research program in the Fobridge project carried out in cooperation with: Gda{\'{n}}sk University of Technology (leader), Military University of Technology in Warsaw, and ROMA Co. Ltd.; and co-financed by NCBR. The aim of the tests was to confirm whether the complex U-shape sandwich structure behaves correctly. The design and technological processes involved in constructing this innovative footbridge required the solving of many problems: absence of standards for design of composite footbridges, lack of standardized material data, lack of guidelines for calculation and evaluation of material strength, and no guidelines for infusion of large, thick sandwich elements. Obtaining answers during the design process demanded extensive experimental tests, development of material models, validation of models, updating parameters and extensive numerical parametric studies. The technological aspects of infusion were tested in numerous trials involving the selection of material parameters and control of the infusion parameters. All scientific validation tests were successfully completed and market assessment showed that the proposed product has potential applications; it can be used for overcoming obstacles in rural areas and cities, as well as in regions affected by natural disasters. Load testing included static and dynamic tests. During the former, the span was examined at 117 independent measurement points. The footbridge was loaded with concrete slabs in different configurations. Their total weight ranged from 140 kN up to 202 kN. The applied load at the most heavily loaded structural points caused an effect from 89{\%} to 120{\%}, compared to the load specified by standards (5 kN/m2). Dynamic tests included standard actions (walking, running, synchronous jumps) as well as aggressive tests, all designed to confirm the usability of the footbridge. The performed trials allowed the identification of the modal and damping parameters of the structure. The designated first natural frequency with a value of 7.8 Hz confirmed the correctness of the U-shape cross-section design due to its significant structural rigidity.},

abstract = {Bridges are the lifelines of disasters in earthquake areas. Therefore, it is very necessary to ensure the safety and traffic function after earthquake. Seismic isolation refers to install external energy dissipation devices or external energy input devices in specific parts of engineering structures. There are certain differences in longitudinal and transverse seismic responses of multi-span continuous beam bridges by changing the seismic dynamic characteristics or dynamic effects of structures. It is difficult to achieve the purpose of seismic isolation in both horizontal directions using isolation devices alone. The rubber deformation ability of lead rubber bearings can effectively insulate, and the yield energy consumption ability of its lead core can effectively consume the seismic energy for damping. The horizontal resistance is very small under the creep load, and the stiffness decreases rapidly after yielding under the strong dynamic earthquake load; meanwhile, the seismic energy is dissipated by the hysteresis of bearing. Fluid viscous damper is a velocity-dependent energy dissipation device, which produces viscous damping force, provides strong restoring force for components, and has a good limit function. This process will also dissipate the seismic energy, so as to reduce the structural earthquake response. Using these two methods together, the horizontal seismic responses of multi-span continuous beam bridges can be effectively controlled at the same time. Based on this idea, this article takes a high-speed multi-span continuous beam bridge with equal section as the engineering background, and uses dynamic time history analysis method to discuss the seismic isolation effect of lead rubber bearings and fluid viscous dampers.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new approach is developed for structural shape optimization, which consists in coupling the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the isogeometric boundary element method (IGA-BEM). The IGA-BEM is based on the combination of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) and the boundary element method (BEM), where Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) are employed as shape functions for geometry parameterization and approximation of the ﬁeld variables. The method inherits the main advantage of the IGA-based shape optimization, i.e., the control points are used as design variables, thus the design model, analysis model and optimization model are uniformly described with the NURBS, providing easy communication between the three models and resulting in a smooth optimized boundary. However, the main feature of the proposed method is the use of PSO, which provides an attractive gradient-free alternative to complicated sensitivity analysis. The eﬃciency and accuracy of the proposed approach are demonstrated through four 2D shape optimization examples.},

abstract = {The numerical modeling of highly damped viscoelastic materials is critical for aerospace applications such as dynamic analysis of solid rocket motors – showing high damping ratios due to the presence of solid propellant – and design of passive damping devices for minimizing vibrations in aeronautical and space systems. Time-domain viscous damping models – giving damping forces proportional to velocities – are directly applicable in transient simulations, but they give a frequency-linear dissipative behavior which has no experimental evidence. On the other hand, frequency-domain hysteretic damping models – giving damping forces proportional to displacements – result in a frequency-constant dissipation that better describes the behavior of certain materials. However, using such models in transient analyses may give unphysical, non–Hermitian and non-causal system response. This paper reviews a class of ﬁrst-principle-based damping models commonly used in structural dynamics by deriving them as particular cases of a general continuum mechanics formulation. The proposed damping models are tuned, in their frequencydomain description, on material experimental data so providing a Hermitian and causal time-domain responses, and they are applied to highly damped, practical aerospace structures via Finite Element models. The proposed model is applied to two aerospace systems: a scaled-down test article dynamically representative of a solid rocket motor launchvehicle stage and a two-dimensional airfoil with passive viscoelastic dampers for ﬂutter suppression.},

It was found that the natural frequency decreased and the modal damping ratio increased with increasing amplitudes of vibration. This paper illustrates the influence of these variations on the train-bridge resonance of this particular bridge by means of a non-linear single degree of freedom system, based on the previously mentioned experimental results. As one might expect, the results indicate that the influence of the increasing damping ratio leads to a considerable decrease in the resonant amplitude whilst the decreasing natural frequency decreases the critical train speed at which resonance occurs. Further studies along this line of research may help us reduce the uncertainties in dynamic assessments of existing bridges based on dynamic measurements and improve our understanding of the dynamic properties of railway bridges in general.},

A simplified beam-element model, a spatial grillage-beam model and a refined shell-element model were built to analyze the bridge structure. A methodology was applied where measured static and dynamic responses were used to update finite element models of L{\aa}ngforsen Bridge. A multi-response objective function was presented, and the finite element method was proved feasible by comparison of predicted and measured response. In the paper comparative analyses were made of the time history displacement of three finite element models under three measured load cases. A standard train model from EUROCODE, HSLM-A 1, was applied and the dynamic responses under different speeds were studied. The results showed that a refined shell element model could accurately analyze dynamic responses of the concrete railway arch bridge in a better way than beam element and spatial grillage models. The dynamic analysis based on this type of shell model can give an optimized suggestion for the railway operation as well as for the design of high-speed railway bridges.},

abstract = {This paper aims to study crowd-induced vibration control of long-span steel footbridges with different dynamic characteristics by combining methods of site measurement and numerical simulation. Four kinds of footbridge models with sensitive vertical natural frequencies of easily generating human-bridge resonance under pedestrian loading are designed based on an actual steel footbridge. The numerical models are ﬁrstly validated by comparative investigation between the site measurement and the simulation. Detailed study on dynamic responses of the four footbridges with and without controlling systems of tuned mass damper (TMD) and multiple tuned mass damper (MTMD) is then conducted under 13 cases of crowd random excitations, rhythmic running and jumping excitations. Results show that the numerical simulation agrees well with the site measurement data. TMD system is found to be highly efﬁcient in reducing vibration responses only when the excitation frequency is basically consistent with the structural natural frequency, which obviously limits the application of TMD system in footbridges as wider excitation frequency bandwidth is caused by human activities. MTMD system are demonstrated to be with higher vibration absorption robustness appearing predominant and stable capacity of reducing structural vibrations under all the crowd random and rhythmic excitations for the four footbridges.},

This algorithm uses two kinds of swarms, a main one that gathers the best particles of auxiliary ones, initialized several times. The auxiliary swarms are initialized in different areas, then an electrostatic repulsion heuristic is applied in each area to increase its diversity. We analyse the performance of the proposed approach on a testbed made of unimodal and multimodal test functions with and without coordinate rotation and shift. The Lennard-Jones potential problem is also used. The proposed algorithm is compared to several other PSO algorithms on this benchmark.

abstract = {In many real-world optimization problems, several conﬂicting objectives must be achieved and optimized simultaneously and the solutions are often required to satisfy certain restrictions or constraints. Moreover, in some applications, the numerical values of the objectives and constraints are obtained from computationally expensive simulations. Many multi-objective optimization algorithms for continuous optimization have been proposed in the literature and some have been incorporated or used in conjunction with expert and intelligent systems. However, relatively few of these multi-objective algorithms handle constraints, and even fewer, use surrogates to approximate the objective or constraint functions when these functions are computationally expensive. This paper proposes a surrogate-assisted evolution strategy (ES) that can be used for constrained multi-objective optimization of expensive black-box objective functions subject to expensive black-box inequality constraints. Such an algorithm can be incorporated into an intelligent system that ﬁnds approximate Pareto optimal solutions to simulation-based constrained multiobjective optimization problems in various applications including engineering design optimization, production management and manufacturing. The main idea in the proposed algorithm is to generate a large number of trial offspring in each generation and use the surrogates to predict the objective and constraint function values of these trial offspring. Then the algorithm performs an approximate non-dominated sort of the trial offspring based on the predicted objective and constraint function values, and then it selects the most promising offspring (those with the smallest predicted ranks from the non-dominated sort) to become the actual offspring for the current generation that will be evaluated using the expensive objective and constraint functions. The proposed method is implemented using cubic radial basis function (RBF) surrogate models to assist the ES. The resulting RBF-assisted ES is compared with the original ES and to NSGA-II on 20 test problems involving 2–15 decision variables, 2–5 objectives and up to 13 inequality constraints. These problems include well-known benchmark problems and application problems in manufacturing and robotics. The numerical results showed that the RBF-assisted ES generally outperformed the original ES and NSGA-II on the problems used when the computational budget is relatively limited. These results suggest that the proposed surrogate-assisted ES is promising for computationally expensive constrained multi-objective optimization.},

abstract = {This article presents a new particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based multi-objective optimization algorithm, named multi-guide particle swarm optimization (MGPSO). The MGPSO is a multi-swarm approach, where each subswarm optimizes one of the objectives. An archive guide is added to the velocity update equation to facilitate convergence to a Pareto front of non-dominated solutions. An extensive empirical and stability analysis of the MGPSO is conducted. The empirical analysis focuses on the exploration behavior of the MGPSO and compares the performance of the MGPSO with that of state-of-the-art multi-objective PSO and evolutionary algorithms. The results show that the MGPSO is highly competitive on a number of benchmark functions. The paper provides a theoretical stability analysis which focuses on the sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for order-1 and order-2 stability of the MGPSO. The paper extends existing work on MGPSO stability analysis by deriving new stability criteria for differing values of the acceleration coefﬁcients used in the velocity update equation.},

abstract = {Free vibrations of a taut cable with a nonlinear power-law damper attached near the end are considered. An approximate analytical solution for the amplitude-dependent effective damping ratios in each mode is developed by assuming the same form of solution as for the linear damper and minimizing the mean-square error in the force equilibrium at the damper. An asymptotic approximate solution for small frequency shifts reveals a nondimensional grouping of parameters allowing the development of an amplitude-dependent "universal estimation curve" for the power-law damper. The shape of the universal curve is slightly different for each value of the damper exponent, but for a given exponent the curve is nearly invariant over the same range of parameters as the universal curve for the linear damper. This formulation yields insights into the dependence of nonlinear damper performance on mode number and amplitude of oscillation, suggesting potential advantages that may be offered by a nonlinear damper over a traditional linear damper.},

Then, utilizing the method of multiple scales, the modulation equations that govern the nonlinear dynamics of the cable-stayed beam are derived. These equations are then utilized to investigate the effect of control gain and time delay on the amplitude and frequency response behavior. Depending on the excitation amplitude and the commensurability of the delayed-response frequency to the excitation frequency, it can be demonstrated that appropriate choice for the feedback gain can greatly reduce the response amplitude of the primary resonance. Finally, numerical simulation is also given to determine the optimal value for control gain and time delays that can improve the vibrations suppression efﬁciency.},

The MR-SVA is numerically and experimentally validated for harmonic excitation of the primary structure when the natural frequency of the passive mass spring system of the MR-SVA is correctly tuned to the targeted structural resonance frequency and when de-tuning is present.

abstract = {The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic based on populations of individuals in which solution candidates evolve through simulation of a simplified model of social adaptation. By aggregating robustness, efficiency and simplicity, PSO has gained great popularity. Modified PSO algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems with domain, linear and nonlinear constraints. Other algorithms that use multi-objective optimization to deal with constrained problems face the problem of not being able to guarantee finding feasible solutions. Current PSO algorithms that deal with constraints only treat domain constraints by controlling the velocity of particle displacement in the swarm, or do so inefficiently by randomly resetting each infeasible particle. This approach may make it infeasible to optimize certain problems, especially real ones. This work presents a new particle swarm optimization algorithm, called PSO+, capable of solving problems with linear and nonlinear constraints in order to solve these deficiencies. The proposed algorithm uses a feasibility repair operator and two swarms to ensure there will always be a swarm whose particles fully respect every constraint. A new particle update method is also proposed to insert diversity into the swarm and improve search-space coverage, allowing the search-space border to be exploited as well, which is particularly convenient when the optimization involves active constraints in global optimum. Two heuristics are proposed to initialize a feasible swarm with the purpose of speeding up the initialization mechanism and ensuring diversity at the starting point of the optimization process. Furthermore, a neighborhood topology is proposed to minimize premature convergence. The proposed algorithm was tested for twenty-four benchmark functions, as well as in a real reservoir drainage plan optimization problem. Results attest that the new algorithm is competitive, since it increases the efficiency of the PSO and the speed of convergence.},

@article{Sarrafi2018,
abstract = {Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques are among the most common approaches for structural damage identification. The presence of damage in structures may be identified by monitoring the changes in dynamic behavior subject to external loading, and is typically performed by using experimental modal analysis (EMA) or operational modal analysis (OMA). These tools for SHM normally require a limited number of physically attached transducers (e.g. accelerometers) in order to record the response of the structure for further analysis. Signal conditioners, wires, wireless receivers and a data acquisition system (DAQ) are also typical components of traditional sensing systems used in vibration-based SHM. However, instrumentation of lightweight structures with contact sensors such as accelerometers may induce mass-loading effects, and for large-scale structures, the instrumentation is labor intensive and time consuming. Achieving high spatial measurement resolution for a large-scale structure is not always feasible while working with traditional contact sensors, and there is also the potential for a lack of reliability associated with fixed contact sensors in outliving the life-span of the host structure. Among the state-of-the-art noncontact measurements, digital video cameras are able to rapidly collect high-density spatial information from structures remotely. In this paper, the subtle motions from recorded video (i.e. a sequence of images) are extracted by means of Phase-based Motion Estimation (PME) and the extracted information is used to conduct damage identification on a 2.3-meter long Skystream{\textregistered} wind turbine blade (WTB). The PME and phased-based motion magnification approach estimates the structural motion from the captured sequence of images for both a baseline and damaged test cases on a wind turbine blade. Operational deflection shapes of the test articles are also quantified and compared for the baseline and damaged states. In addition, having proper lighting while working with high-speed cameras can be an issue, therefore image enhancement and contrast manipulation has also been performed to enhance the raw images. Ultimately, the extracted resonant frequencies and operational deflection shapes are used to detect the presence of damage, demonstrating the feasibility of implementing non-contact video measurements to perform realistic structural damage detection.},

In this paper, we propose a variation of the algorithm called Parallel Swarms Oriented Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-PSO) which consists of a multi-stage and a singlestage of evolution. In the multi-stage of evolution, individual sub-swarms evolve independently in parallel and in the single-stage of evolution the sub-swarms exchange information to search for the global best. The two interweaved stages of evolution demonstrate better performance on test functions, especially of higher dimensions. The attractive feature of the PSO-PSO version of the algorithm is that it does not introduce any new parameters to improve its convergence performance. The strategy maintains the simple and intuitive structure as well as the implemental and computational advantages of the basic PSO.},

abstract = {In order to evaluate the usefulness of approaches based on modal parameters tracking for structural health monitoring of bridges, in September of 2007, a dynamic monitoring system was installed in a concrete arch bridge at the city of Porto, in Portugal. The implementation of algorithms to perform the continuous on-line identification of modal parameters based on structural responses to ambient excitation (automated Operational Modal Analysis) has permitted to create a very complete database with the time evolution of the bridge modal characteristics during more than 2 years. This paper describes the strategy that was followed to minimize the effects of environmental and operational factors on the bridge natural frequencies, enabling, in a subsequent stage, the identification of structural anomalies. Alternative static and dynamic regression models are tested and complemented by a Principal Components Analysis. Afterwards, the identification of damages is tried with control charts. At the end, it is demonstrated that the adopted processing methodology permits the detection of realistic damage scenarios, associated with frequency shifts around 0.2{\%}, which were simulated with a numerical model.},

abstract = {Structural damping in high-speed railway bridges is a key parameter that affects significantly the performance of the structure in terms of fatigue life and comfort of the passengers and hence has a significant impact on the design procedures. For these reasons its accurate assessment is a paramount task to be performed and hence the results of an experimental campaign carried out on a prestressed concrete (four box-girder) beam bridge of the new Italian high-speed network are presented in this work. A total amount of fifteen accelerometers were used to ensure redundancy of measurements. Both a time domain technique and a Frequency-Domain Decomposition (FDD) technique are used to analyse the vibration signals and extract the modal frequencies, shapes and damping ratio of the first mode of the structure. The results are compared with the design provisions, and with other expectation provided by the technical literature. The paper from one hand provides a contribution in the framework of the damping evaluation of high-speed railway bridges, and from the other hand would furnish a first assessment of those damping sources that are not usually accounted for in the modelling process.},

abstract = {There is a large number of old arch bridges in Iran's railway network which the majority of them have been built more than 70 years ago. These structures, though displaying a good performance under the eﬀect of service (gravity) loads but the seismic (lateral) loads have not been taken into account in their design; therefore, the seismic assessment of these structures is deemed necessary for obtaining their failure and seismic performance levels. So they can be strengthened or rendered out of order in case it is found necessary. There are numerous methods for evaluating the residual capacity of the structures under seismic excitation which among them the non-linear dynamic analysis or the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is the most accurate and perfect method. Selecting 22 far-ﬁeld earthquake records, the present study investigated two plain concrete arch bridges which are located in kilometers 23 and 24 of the old Tehran-Qom railway, respectively. By using the ﬁnite element method and the macro-modeling method the km-23 and km-24 bridges were simulated and totally 231 non-linear dynamic analyses have been conducted. The results obtained from the incremental dynamic analysis indicated that the seismic behavior of the bridge with longer span length is more vulnerable (km-23) than the bridge with lower span length (km-24). Generally, the seismic performance of plain concrete arch bridges has been found inappropriate, therefore to improve their performance it is necessary to retroﬁt these type of structures.},

abstract = {Although building structures can be designed to meet the life safety criterion and to deform inelastically without inducing collapse under major earthquakes, the structural and nonstructural damage associated with inelastic responses is normally very costly to repair. In this paper, friction dampers are utilized to upgrade the seismic performance of timber-steel hybrid structure, which has been proposed as an alternative structural solution for multi-story buildings. The hybrid structural system consists of steel moment resisting frame and inﬁll light wood frame shear wall, both of which serve as the main lateral load resisting components, and friction dampers are introduced as frame-to-wall connectors to mitigate earthquake-induced damage. Pseudo-static loading tests were carried out on three timber-steel hybrid lateral load resisting subassemblies, and test results showed that the friction dampers were very effective in dissipating earthquake input energy, and correspondingly, much less damage was observed within the main structural members. The software package OpenSees was used to simulate the hysteretic behavior of the hybrid structure, and the developed ﬁnite element model was further validated by test results. Moreover, an optimal damper design solution was provided for a four-story timber-steel hybrid prototype building according to the numerical results from massive time-history analyses. Finally, the ﬂoor acceleration and inter-story drift responses of the prototype building with optimal damper conﬁgurations were assessed. This research aims to contribute to the development of novel timber hybrid structural systems with enhanced seismic performance.},

The nature of a discrete viscous damper's effect on the fundamental frequency of a beam is revealed as the method is applied to the case of a cantilevered beam. In this process, it is shown that damping has the capacity to increase the fundamental frequency of the beam, and that there exists both a particular location and critical value of damping that maximize this frequency.},

In addition, the paper describes the authors'experiences in initially constructing the FE models and conducting the updating itself. Finally, the practical meaning of the changes to the assumed model parameters, resulting from the updating, is discussed.

We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-conﬁdence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

abstract = {Navigation locks are critical infrastructure components, and their closure for maintenance and repair can have significant impacts on the global economy. The current state of inspection and monitoring of lock components is generally to close the lock and perform a visual inspection. Whereas structural health monitoring of navigation locks is gaining acceptance, automation of the structural health monitoring process is lacking. This paper reports on efforts to develop an automated damage detection system for miter gates of navigation locks. The study focuses on using strain gage measurements to identify the redistribution of load throughout lock gates in the presence of damage. To eliminate the environmental variability in the data, a new damage‐sensitive feature is introduced, termed here as “slope” and defined as the derivative of the strain with respect to the water levels in the lock chamber. The slopes form a new, stationary time series effectively purged of environmental effects. A principal component analysis, a method of analyzing multivariate, stationary time series, is then used to detect significant changes in the statistics of slopes as an indication of damage. To validate the approach, damage is simulated in a finite element model, and the resulting changes in strain from the finite element model are superimposed on the measured data. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for detecting damage in navigational lock gates.},

Driven from the fact that aesthetic design goals are not easily quantifiable, key elements are introduced and implemented herein towards an interactive framework for algorithmic design of truss structures. Within this framework, the user can visually assess interesting solutions, save them for later assessment, actively drive the optimization towards individual aims, re-initialize the optimization with a set of available solutions, or restart the design process. A criterion is introduced as a means of quantifying subjective goals, expressing the similarity of the shape of candidate solutions with respect to reference designs. The framework is tested on a benchmark case and then applied to the design of a truss tower. The effectiveness of the similarity criteria, as well as the ability of the user to drive the process towards specific design goals is demonstrated.},

The parameters are estimated by using the least squares method via the implementation of the QR factorization. A new noise ratebased factor called the Noise rate Order Factor (NOF) is introduced for use in the effective selection of model order and noise rate estimation. For the selection of structural modes, an orderwise criterion called the Order Modal Assurance Criterion (OMAC) is used, based on the correlation of mode shapes computed from two successive orders. Speciﬁcally, the algorithm is updated with respect to model order from a small value to produce a costeffective computation. Furthermore, the conﬁdence intervals of each natural frequency, damping ratio and mode shapes are also computed and evaluated with respect to model order and noise rate. This method is thus very effective for identifying the modal parameters in case of ambient vibrations dealing with modern output-only modal analysis. Simulations and discussions on a steel plate structure are presented, and the experimental results show good agreement with the ﬁnite element analysis.},

In this paper, a decoupling approximation for dynamic response analysis of the vertically mixed structure is proposed. The optimal equivalent uniform damping ratio can be evaluated in a sense of response error minimization. It is calculated by using the superposition response spectrum method which takes the full frequency content of the ground motion into consideration rather than the harmonic excitation at a speciﬁed frequency only. The equivalent uniform damping ratios presented here are then validated by comparison with full time history analysis. Over the most part of the (R$\omega$–Rm) parametrical plane, the response error is relatively small for the each component structural parts. And then, the proposed damping ratios are tested in actual MDOF concrete/steel irregular structures. It is shown that the proposed procedure is proved to be feasible in use for practical design.},

Through a simple example of a simply supported beam traversed by a moving mass, several fundamental concepts peculiar to moving-load problems are introduced. The necessary mathematics involved is presented. The analytical procedure is also presented for a circular plate excited by a rotating oscillator. Then numerical results of a circular beam spinning about its longitudinal axis excited by an axially moving surface load are provided. A variety of moving-load problems are brieﬂy reviewed with some published papers and books to help readers quickly get into problems of their interests. Readers are expected to get a ﬂavour of what moving-load problems are about, what general methods are available and what research has been done from studying this tutorial. Knowledge of partial differential equations and vibration theory of beams and plates is required in order to understand this tutorial.},

abstract = {New seismic dampers termed Buckling-Restrained Rippled Plate (BRRP) dampers have been developed. The BRRP dampers are similar in shape to BRB (Buckling-Restrained Brace) dampers, but its core member is a 2D rippled plate instead of a 1D narrow ﬂat plate. BRRPs are intended to be used as stoppers, and when they are installed at the edges of girder-type bridges, they will act as stiff elastic bearings in small to moderate earthquakes (called ‘‘Level 1 earthquakes” in Japan) and as energy dissipating dampers in large earthquakes (called ‘‘Level 2 earthquakes” in Japan). The target performance of BRRPs is such that they can withstand earthquakes exceeding Level 2 earthquakes (say, 1.5 times larger than a Level 2 earthquake). The inelastic behavior of BRRPs was investigated using both cyclic loading tests and numerical analyses to acquire fundamental knowledge on their performances. It has been found that adequately designed BRRPs exhibit much better deformation and low-cycle fatigue performance than conventional BRBs.},

These algorithms are tested on the updating of two real structures namely; an unsymmetrical H-shaped beam and a GARTEUR SM-AG19 structure. The results thereof are compared with results of two other metaheuristic algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on the same structures. The GA and PSO algorithms being the most popular metaheuristic algorithms used in the model updating area. It is observed that on average, the FSS and PSO algorithms produce more accurate results than the GA. In this paper we conﬁrm that the FSSb (i.e. a customised version of the FSS algorithm, with minor modiﬁcations) and the hybrid algorithm – the Volitive PSO (i.e. the volitive operator of FSS into PSO) – are also more effective in this optimization task, producing superior results when updating the underlining Finite Element Model of both structures.},

abstract = {In this paper the use of the Tuned Mass Damper Inerter (TMDI) to control the response of base isolated structures under stochastic horizontal base acceleration is examined. Notably, the TMDI, recently introduced as a generalization of the classical Tuned Mass Damper, allows to achieve enhanced performance compared to the other passive vibration control devices. Thus, it represents an ideal alternative for reducing displacements of base isolated structures. To this aim, ﬁrstly a straightforward numerical approach is developed for the optimal design of this device considering a white noise base excitation. Further, a simpliﬁed analytical solution for the optimal design of TMDI parameters for base isolated structures is proposed minimizing the displacement variance of the corresponding undamped base isolated system. A thorough numerical analysis is performed and related results, in terms of optimal parameters and control performance, are compared with pertinent data obtained by a more computationally demanding iterative optimization procedure on the original damped system, considering both white noise and coloured noise stationary base excitation. Analytical and numerical results are found in good agreement, especially in terms of control performance, thus establishing the reliability and efﬁciency of the proposed approach. Finally, numerical analyses on a ﬁve-story benchmark base isolated structure controlled with an optimally designed TMDI are performed considering real recorded ground motions as base excitation. It is concluded that the TMDI, properly optimized with the proposed procedure, can effectively reduce the response of base isolated structures even under strong earthquakes.},

@article{Rada-Vilela2014,
abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic whose performance deteriorates signiﬁcantly when utilized on optimization problems subject to noise. On these problems, particles eventually fail to distinguish good from bad solutions because their objective values are corrupted by noise. Speciﬁcally, the effect of noise causes particles to suffer from deception when they do not select their true neighborhood best solutions, from blindness when they ignore better solutions, and from disorientation when they prefer worse solutions. Resampling methods reduce the presence of these conditions by re-evaluating the solutions multiple times and better estimating their true objective values with a sample mean over the evaluations. PSO with Equal Resampling (PSO-ER) ﬁnds better solutions than the regular PSO thanks mainly to the reduction of deception and blindness, as has been found by utilizing a set of population statistics that track the presence of these conditions throughout the search process. However, the solutions of PSO-ER have been reported to be worse than those of state-of-the-art resampling-based PSO algorithms, and the underlying reasons are not known because the population statistics for such algorithms have never been computed. In this article, we study the population statistics for a new extension to PSO-ER that further reduces the presence of blindness, and for state-ofthe-art resampling-based PSO algorithms. Experiments on 20 large-scale benchmark functions subject to different levels of noise show that our new algorithm succeeds at reducing blindness and ﬁnding better solutions than PSO-ER. However, the population statistics for state-of-the-art resampling-based PSO algorithms show that their particles suffer even less from deception, blindness and disorientation, and therefore ﬁnd much better solutions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a semi-active tuned mass damper (STMD) with acceleration and relative motion feedbacks that is optimised in the frequency domain to ensure the same vibration damping efﬁciency as the Den Hartog's tuned mass damper (TMD) of up to seven times larger mass. The proposed STMD has attractive features. Firstly, its effectiveness under harmonic excitation is equivalent – also in the case of frequency detuning – to the TMD with K-times larger mass, where K, ranging from 2 to 7, is the main design parameter of the STMD. Secondly, its maximal displacement is not greater than for the TMD having the same mass. Finally, its structure is almost as simple as that of the TMD and it is formed by replacing a viscous damper in the TMD with a controllable damper, for example a magnetorheological damper. The paper presents the tuning of the feedback gains that are introduced along with their correction factors aiming at minimisation of the adverse effect of clipping the active forces. Finding the optimal correction factors together with their polynomial approximations are reported. Due to the practical importance of the proposed STMD, its complete numerical validation as well as in-depth characterisation are provided.},

The true maximum load effect might occur at some other bridge section and its magnitude could be significantly greater. This paper quantifies the underestimation of the load effects as a result of exclusively considering the middle section, with special emphasis on resonant situations. A 2D numerical model of a vehicle–track–bridge system was used to evaluate different vehicle velocities, bridge properties and track irregularity conditions. The error due to the mid-span assumption depends on the particular case considered but can be related to the relative energy content of the higher modes of vibration. The results show that the error is greatest for accelerations, smaller for bending moments and is almost negligible for displacements.},

Herein, the vehicle is simpliﬁed as a spring–damper–mass system and coupled to the bridge by its interactional force in the governing equations based on the Timoshenko beam theory. According to the symplectic orthogonality of the state vectors, the orthogonality of the mode shapes of the Timoshenko beams is proved, and the dynamic responses of the continuous beam bridges with different spans and variable cross sections can be solved by the mode superposition method. More complicated factors, such as harmonic load on vehicles, noise in measurement, and roughness of pavements, can also be conveniently taken into account. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated using some numerical examples and applied to a real bridge. The results indicate that the method is convenient, efﬁcient, and precise for engineering applications.},

Similar challenges apply to other extreme structures such as tall buildings, masts, offshore lighthouses and extended geotechnical structures stretching technology requirements for both instrumentation and signal interpretation. A solution for instrumentation is autonomous ‘wireless' recorders. The problem with signal interpretation is the reliability of the modal parameter estimates that is particularly challenged with low frequency modes, which ‘third generation' operational modal analysis procedures offer using Bayesian approaches.

abstract = {Practical simulation technology is of great importance in the design and research of the maglev system. This paper presents a practical vehicle/guideway model based on an in situ vibration test and model updating method. In this model, the guideway is established by the Finite Element method and then updated by the measurement, and the vehicle is simulated as a 10-degree-of-freedom model, which consists of a car-body and eight magnets. The vehicle interacts with the guideway by the magnetic interactive forces, which are tuned by the current feedback controller. The vehicle/guideway interaction problem is solved by the proposed incremental iteration procedure. Two case studies including the Shanghai High-speed Maglev Commercial Operational Line and the High-speed Maglev Test Line at Tongji University were presented for the validation of the proposed model. Finally, the effects of random surface irregularity and distributed magnetic forces were investigated here, and the frequency response of the guideway was analyzed in detail. The results indicate that the proposed model can provide a practical response prediction and analysis because the dynamic characteristics of the guideway and the excitation frequency of the maglev train are reasonably considered in this model.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization is a popular nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm and has been used extensively to solve single- and multi-objective optimization problems over the last two decades. Several local and global search strategies, and learning and parameter adaptation strategies have been included in particle swarm optimization to improve its performance over the years. Most of these approaches are observed to increase the number of user-deﬁned parameters and algorithmic steps resulting in an increased complexity of the algorithm. This paper presents a simpliﬁed multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm in which the exploitation (guided) and exploration (random) moves are simpliﬁed using a detailed qualitative analysis of similar existing operators present in the real-coded elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The developed algorithm is then tested quantitatively on 30 well-known benchmark problems and compared with a real-coded elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, and its variant with a simulated binary jumping gene operator and multi-objective non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization algorithm. In the comparison, the developed algorithm is found to be superior in terms of convergence speed. It is also found to be better with respect to four recent multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms and four differential evolution variants in an extended comparative analysis. Finally, it is applied to a newly formulated industrial multi-objective optimization problem of a residue (bottom product from the crude distillation unit) ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit where it shows a better performance than the other compared algorithms.},

@article{Brandt2014,
abstract = {Integrating sampled time signals is a common task in signal processing. In this paper we investigate the performance of two straightforward integration methods: (i) integration in the frequency domain by a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), division by jx followed by inverse DFT (IDFT) back to the time domain, and (ii) a method using a weighted overlap-add (WOLA) technique which is developed in the paper. These two methods are compared with two time domain methods: (a) the trapezoidal rule, and (b) an optimized IIR ﬁlter. It is shown that the intuitive method of a straightforward DFT/IDFT is a very good method which is recommended for data lengths exceeding 16 K samples, provided data are short enough to allow a single DFT. The IIR ﬁlter integration is shown to have very similar accuracy and can also be recommended. The WOLA integration method is shown to perform well in most cases for steady-state conditions. For cases with short transients it should, however, be avoided. A signal integrated by the WOLA method is further shown to be incoherent with the signal before integration. This suggests that the WOLA method should be avoided in cases where coherence between the signals before and after integration is important. It is also demonstrated by a simulation example that integration by the trapezoidal rule should be avoided, as it gives biased results, particularly for higher frequencies.},

abstract = {Rayleigh damping is commonly used to provide a source of energy dissipation in analyses of structures responding to dynamic loads such as earthquake ground motions. In a finite element model, the Rayleigh damping matrix consists of a mass-proportional part and a stiffness-proportional part; the latter typically uses the initial linear stiffness matrix of the structure. Under certain conditions, for example, a non-linear analysis with softening non-linearity, the damping forces generated by such a matrix can become unrealistically large compared to the restoring forces, resulting in an analysis being unconservative. Potential problems are demonstrated in this paper through a series of examples. A remedy to these problems is proposed in which bounds are imposed on the damping forces.

abstract = {Resonance vibrations have been observed on railway bridges subjected to high speed trains. An elementary theoretical model of a bridge was investigated using the integral transformation method which provides an estimation of the amplitudes of the free vibration In addition, the analysis gives the critical speeds at which the resonance vibration may occur. They are caused by two reasons: repeated action of axle loads and high speed itself. While the first cause of critical speeds has been reached on today's high speed lines the second one not yet. The maximum amplitudes of resonance vibration appear at the moment when the last axle leaves the bridge and, therefore, their values were calculated for the deflection, bending moment and acceleration of the bridge deck. Simple expressions similar to dynamic impact factor were given to these values which enable to assess the railway bridges for high speed trains. Comparison of the theory with the experiments is satisfactory. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Compared with the weighted path graph, the weighted horizontal visibility graph (WHVG) can reﬂect the dynamics characteristics of vibration signals better. When the fault bearing vibration signal is transformed into the WHVG, GFT can cluster most of the fault impulse component to the highest order range and has strong anti-interference ability. Based on WHVG and GFT, a novel fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings is proposed. In the proposed method, the graph spectrum coefﬁcients in the highest order range are extracted to reconstruct the fault impulse component, and then the Hilbert envelope spectrum is used to diagnose the bearing fault. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings is noise tolerant and effective.},

abstract = {A vibration-based bridge scour detection procedure using a cantilever-based piezoelectric energy harvesting device (EHD) is proposed here. This has an advantage over an accelerometer-based method in that potentially, the requirement for a power source can be negated with the only power requirement being the storage and/or transmission of the data. Ideally, this source of power could be fulﬁlled by the EHD itself, although much research is currently being done to explore this. The open-circuit EHD voltage is used here to detect bridge frequency shifts arising due to scour. Using one EHD attached to the central bridge pier, both scour at the pier of installation and scour at another bridge pier can be detected from the EHD voltage generated during the bridge free-vibration stage, while the harvester is attached to a healthy pier. The method would work best with an initial modal analysis of the bridge structure in order to identify frequencies that may be sensitive to scour. Frequency components corresponding to harmonic loading and electrical interference arising from experiments are removed using the ﬁlter bank property of singular spectrum analysis (SSA). These frequencies can then be monitored by using harvested voltage from the energy harvesting device and successfully utilised towards structural health monitoring of a model bridge aﬀected by scour.},

In this paper, different boundary conditions are categorized into two groups, namely, restricted and unrestricted, according to whether the errant particles are relocated inside the allowable solution space or not. Moreover, efforts are made to explore different hybrid unrestricted boundary conditions by introducing the favorable characteristics of the reﬂecting and damping boundary conditions into the existing invisible boundary condition. The performances of the boundary conditions are tested based on both mathematical benchmark functions and a real-world electromagnetic problem: the optimization of a 2-D 16-element array antenna. Simulation results are examined from both the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the algorithm. Comparisons show that the unrestricted boundary conditions are more efﬁcient when the global optimum is inside the boundary of the solution space, and the damping boundary condition is more robust and consistent when the global optimum is close to the boundary.},

In order to simulate MR damper's performance under impact load, fuzzy controller and fuzzy PID controller were exploited to evaluate their controllability. Besides, a suit of intelligent monitoring and controlling system which used a closed bump to produce an impact load for MR damper was designed and exploited. Experiment results indicated that the designed MR damper could effectively reduce the shock vibration and achieve good control effect. Compared to other control methods, the fuzzy control strategy could reduce off 20{\%} its displacement and pressure of MR damper under impact load.},

abstract = {In order to obtain a precise dynamic structural FE model for dynamic analysis, FE model updating is usually used to correct uncertainty parameters for an initial FE model using incomplete measured data. Despite numerous studies concerning FE model updating, the computational cost is still a challenging issue for the repeated eigenvalue structures. Firstly, an improved modal assurance criterion is proposed to evaluate the similarity of mode shapes for the repeated eigenvalue structures in this paper. And then, a novel ROM-based FE model updating framework consisting of an off-line phase and an on-line phase is proposed. In the off-line phase, a reduced-order basis is constructed by extracting primary components of a snapshot matrix using a proper orthogonal decomposition technique. The snapshot matrix represents a collection of static displacement vectors of the FE model under radial nodal loads, which are determined by incomplete measured mode shapes. In the on-line phase, FE model updating is performed via a reduced-order model with much cheaper computational cost. Finally, a numerical example and an experimental example demonstrate the accuracy and efﬁciency of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the proposed ROM-based FE model updating framework is more efﬁcient and stable than the FOM-based FE model updating framework.},

abstract = {This paper presents an improvement to the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) with natural excitation technique (NExT), which is called the ERA-NExT-AVG method. The method uses a coded average of row vectors in each Markov parameter for evaluating modal properties of a structure. The modification is important because, for the existing stochastic system identification methods, the state-space model, obtained from output sensor data, is usually overparameterized resulting in large systems. Solving such a problem can be computationally very intensive especially in the applications when using the computational capabilities of embedded sensor networks. As a way to improve the efficiency of the ERA-NExT method, the proposed method focuses on the number of components in a single Markov parameter, which can theoretically be minimized down to the number of structural modes. Applying the coded average column vectors as Markov parameters to the ERA, the computational cost of the algorithm is significantly reduced, whereas the accuracy of the estimates is maintained or improved. Numerical simulations are performed for a shear frame model subjected to Gaussian white noise ground excitation. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing the accuracy and computational cost of the estimated modal parameters using the proposed method, with several other stochastic modal identification methods including the ERA-observer Kalman filter identification, ERA-NExT, and autoregressive models. The performance of the method is then evaluated by applying it to ambient vibration data from the Golden Gate bridge, collected using a dense wireless sensor network, and its vertical and torsional modes are successfully and accurately identified.

abstract = {Seismic vibration due to earthquake can damage the curved bridges that are the main interconnecting component for traffic separation structures of the urban highway system. Failure of bridges during and after a seismic event is vulnerable as bridges are lifeline structures. This work investigates the application of semi-active variable stiffness damper for a seismic control of the horizontally curved bridge isolated with different passive devices. The main objectives of the study are to investigate the effectiveness of the hybrid system and to find the optimum hybrid system for the seismic control of the curved bridge with different control laws of a damper. The selected bridge is a three-span continuous concrete box girder supported on pier and rigid abutment. The bridge deck is modeled as a single spine beam and the supporting pier is modeled as linear lumped mass system. The bridge is excited with four different ground motions having different ground motion characteristics with all three-ground motion components (horizontal as well as vertical). The results of the analysis demonstrate that the use of semi-active variable stiffness damper with different isolators is very effective in controlling the response of the curved bridge. The combination of semi-active variable stiffness damper and lead rubber bearing can provide an effective way for overall seismic control of the curved bridge. The use of modified switching control law for damper is as effective as switching control law with less number of sensors.},

abstract = {Footbridges usually suffer from vibrations induced by the actions of pedestrians, which calls for various control measures to improve the serviceability. This study described the dynamic analysis and Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) implementation for a singlepylon cable-stayed footbridge scaled model, aimed at providing an experimental case study regarding of vibration control design of slender structures. A scaled model for the real footbridge was designed based on similarity principles. Then, the dynamic behavior of the footbridge was assessed by ambient vibration tests. The natural frequencies and mode shapes were identified from operational vibration measurements by covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification algorithm. The frequency of first vertical bending modes is 2.10 Hz, falling into the human walking frequency range [1.6, 2.4] Hz. Therefore, the footbridge needs vibration control to improve its serviceability. Finally, a self-made TMD using lead, spring and oil buffer was implemented on the scaled model of the footbridge. The laboratory forced vibration test was employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the TMD. By installing TMD, the acceleration response at mid-span of the footbridge was remarkably reduced. The study could provide meaningful reference for vibration control design of the full-scale footbridge.},

abstract = {The lateral vibration serviceability of slender footbridges has been the subject of many studies over the last few decades. However, in spite of the large amount of research, a common criterion has not been set yet. Although the human–structure interaction phenomenon is widely accepted as the main cause of the sudden onset of high amplitudes of vibration, the current design recommendations do not include an expression for the auto-induced component of the pedestrian action and, as a consequence, it is not possible to evaluate the footbridge comfort once the lock-in eﬀect has developed. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to propose a general formulation, which allows the analysis of the diﬀerent load scenarios that the footbridge will experience during its overall life cycle. An important advantage over most current design guidelines is that the procedure permits the evaluation of the comfort level of the footbridge, even with crowd densities above the “critical number”, and thus takes informed decisions about the possible use of external devices to control the vibration response, depending on the probability of occurrence of the problem. The performance of the proposed method is successfully evaluated through numerical response simulations of two real footbridges, showing a good agreement with the experimental data.},

abstract = {Wind turbines are immense, flexible structures with aerodynamic forces acting on the rotating blades at harmonics of the turbine rotational frequency. These harmonics are comparable to the modal frequencies of the structure. Predicting and experimentally measuring the modal frequencies of wind turbines have been important to their successful design and operation. Performing modal tests on wind turbine structures over 100m tall is a substantial challenge, which has inspired innovative developments in modal test technology. For wind turbines, a further complication is that the modal frequencies are dependent on the turbine rotation speed. The history and development of a new technique for acquiring the modal parameters using output-only response data, called the Natural Excitation Technique (NExT), will be reviewed, showing historical tests and techniques. The initial attempts at output-only modal testing began in the late 1980s with the development of NExT in the 1990s. NExT was a predecessor to Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), developed to overcome these challenges of testing immense structures excited with natural environmental inputs. We will trace the difficulties and successes of wind turbine modal testing from 1982 to the present.},

abstract = {The non-proportionally damped system is very common in practical engineering structures. The dynamic equations for these systems, in which the damping matrices are coupled, are very time consuming to solve. In this paper, a modal perturbation method is proposed, which only requires the ﬁrst few lower real mode shapes of a corresponding undamped system to obtain the complex mode shapes of non-proportionally damped system. In this method, an equivalent proportionally damped system is constructed by taking the real mode shapes of a corresponding undamped system and then transforming the characteristic equation of state space into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations by using the vibration modes of an equivalent proportionally damped system. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed modal perturbation method. The numerical results show that: (1) with the increase of vibration modes of the corresponding undamped system, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors monotonically converge to exact solutions; (2) the accuracy of the proposed method is signiﬁcantly higher than the ﬁrst-order perturbation method and proportional damping method. The calculation time of the proposed method is shorter than the state space method; (3) the method is particularly suitable for ﬁnding a few individual orders of frequency and mode of a system with highly non-proportional damping.},

abstract = {The mitigation of in-plane stay oscillation in cable-stayed bridges is commonly addressed by placing an external mechanical damper, linear or nonlinear, on each stay or by introducing transverse cross-ties among cables. Although the problem of a cable with a single external damper has found signiﬁcant attention in the past and different techniques have been proposed for the solution of the free-vibration problem, limitations are related to the fact that the location of the damper is usually very close to the cable end ͑on the bridge deck side͒ due to geometric constraints, leading to inherently low modal damping in the fundamental modes. In this paper the installation of more than one damper on an individual stay is considered to overcome such limitations and to increase the overall performance of the system. An existing procedure, based on the linearized taut-string theory, was modiﬁed to allow for the presence of multiple external discrete viscous dampers. The case of two devices with arbitrary location has been solved, identifying advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution. In addition, extensions of the practical “universal curve” and the interpretation thereof are presented.},

abstract = {The paper deals with the dynamic analysis of multiply supported continuous beams subjected to moving loads, which in turn can be modelled either as moving forces or moving masses. A dedicated variant of the component mode synthesis (CMS) method is proposed in which the classical primary–secondary substructure approach (SA) is tailored to cope with slender (i.e. Euler–Bernoulli) continuous beams with arbitrary geometry. To do this, the whole structure is ideally decomposed in primary and secondary spans with convenient restraints, whose exact eigenfunctions are used as assumed local modes; the representation of the internal forces is improved with the help of two additional assumed modes for each primary span, while primary–secondary inﬂuence functions allow satisfying the kinematical compatibility between adjacent spans; the continuous beam is then re-assembled, and the Lagrange's equations of motion are derived in a compact block-matrix setting for both moving force and moving mass model. Numerical examples demonstrate accuracy and efﬁciency of the proposed procedure. An application with a platoon of high-speed moving masses conﬁrms that the inertial effects neglected in the moving force model may have a signiﬁcant impact in the structural response.},

Next, a mode-shape-based damage detection (MBDD) method is outlined. A damage index algorithm to localize and estimate the severity of damage from monitoring changes in modal strain energy is formulated. The FBDD method and the MBDD method are evaluated for several damage scenarios by locating and sizing damage in numerically simulated prestressed concrete beams for which two natural frequencies and mode shapes are generated from ﬁnite element models. The result of the analyses indicates that the FBDD method and the MBDD method correctly localize the damage and accurately estimate the sizes of the cracks simulated in the test beam.},

One subject of this program has been a short-span bridge taking a busy main road across a coastal inlet near a major port facility. Experiment-based structural assessments of the bridge were conducted before and after upgrading works including strengthening. Each assessment exercise comprised three separate components: ͑1͒ a strain and acceleration monitoring exercise lasting approximately one month; ͑2͒ a full-scale dynamic test carried out in a single day without closing the bridge; and ͑3͒ a ﬁnite-element model updating exercise to identify structural parameters and mechanisms. This paper presents the dynamic testing and the modal analysis used to identify the vibration properties and the quantiﬁcation of the effectiveness of the upgrading through the subsequent model updating. Before and after upgrade, similar sets of vibration modes were identiﬁed, resembling those of an orthotropic plate with relatively weak transverse bending stiffness. Conversion of bearings from nominal simple supports to nominal full ﬁxity was shown via model updating to be the principal cause of natural frequency increases of up to 50{\%}. The utility of the combined experimental and analytical process in direct identiﬁcation of structural properties has been proven, and the procedure can be applied to other structures and their capacity assessments.},

@article{Lv2019,
abstract = {For multi-objective optimization problems, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm generally needs a large number of fitness evaluations to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions. However, it will become substantially time-consuming when handling computationally expensive fitness functions. In order to save the computational cost, a surrogate-assisted PSO with Pareto active learning is proposed. In real physical space (the objective functions are computationally expensive), PSO is used as an optimizer, and its optimization results are used to construct the surrogate models. In virtual space, objective functions are replaced by the cheaper surrogate models, PSO is viewed as a sampler to produce the candidate solutions. To enhance the quality of candidate solutions, a hybrid mutation sampling method based on the simulated evolution is proposed, which combines the advantage of fast convergence of PSO and implements mutation to increase diversity. Furthermore, $\epsilon$-Pareto active learning ($\epsilon$-PAL) method is employed to pre-select candidate solutions to guide PSO in the real physical space. However, little work has considered the method of determining parameter $\epsilon$. Therefore, a greedy search method is presented to determine the value of $\epsilon$ where the number of active sampling is employed as the evaluation criteria of classification cost. Experimental studies involving application on a number of benchmark test problems and parameter determination for multi-input multi-output least squares support vector machines (MLSSVM) are given, in which the results demonstrate promising performance of the proposed algorithm compared with other representative multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithms.},

abstract = {Stay cables are one of the most critical structural components in modern cable-stayed bridges and the cable tension plays an important role in the construction, control and monitoring of cable-stayed bridges. We propose a time domain and a time–frequency domain approaches for modal parameter identiﬁcation of stay cables using output-only measurements. The time domain approach uses the subspace algorithm which is improved with a new modal coherence indicator. The time–frequency approach uses the wavelet transform of signals which is improved with a new analyzing wavelet. The wavelet transform is applied to the free response of ambient vibration which is obtained using the random decrement technique. Two experiments of stay cables are presented. The ﬁrst experiment concerns a stay cable in laboratory where the external load is applied through an impact hammer and the vibratory signals are acquired through four accelerometers. The second experiment concerns the Jinma cable-stayed bridge that connects Guangzhou and Zhaoqing in China. It is a single tower, double row cablestayed bridge supported by 112 stay cables. Ambient vibration of each stay cable is carried out using accelerometers. From output-only measurements, the modal parameters of stay cables are extracted. Once the eigenfrequencies and the damping coefﬁcients are obtained, the cable forces and the Scruton number are derived. In a continuous monitoring and modal analysis process, the tension forces and Scruton numbers could be used to assess the health of stay cables in cable-stayed bridges.},

Compared to the ballast track, the concrete track extended the location of the neutral axis of the structure by about 6{\%} in the upward direction. Moreover, the dynamic responses of the structure linearly increased with the maximum load and dramatically increased with the load amplitude during resonance. However, the damping ratio was the same with and without a track system.

Reduction of labor costs with an increase in the reliability of information about the state of damage and technical condition is an actual scientific and practical task. One of the ways to solve it is to use non-destructive vibration diagnostic methods. The purpose of carrying out diagnostics with the use of vibration based damage detection methods is to search for damages in structural elements that can cause the deviation of the dynamic parameters of a structure from calculated ones. Determination of the dynamic parameters of the structure, in particular natural frequencies and mode shapes of mechanical systems, is one of the most important tasks that allows obtaining integral information about the state of a structure. This article presents the results of calculations for the localization of slabs defects in a multi-storey building with a transverse crack, span L = 4.5 (m), height H = 0.2 (m), with prestressed reinforcement d = 0.05 (m). Vibration based Damage Index method was used to localize the defect. During the study, reliable localization values of the defect area of the slab were obtained, this indicates that the vibration method for determining the damage index with a sufficient degree of accuracy allowed predicting the site of damage to the structure.},

The O-PCPSO-ICS consists of one memory and bottom multiple swarms. In O-PCPSO-ICS, the global best individuals are saved into the antibody memory and promoted by using the improved ICS operator. An opposition-based learning operator is employed to accelerate the convergence speed of Pbests. Furthermore, excellent search information is spread among different subpopulations by a migration scheme. Finally, the proposed method is running on multi-core architecture using open multiprocessing (OpenMP).The numerical simulations validated the O-PCPSO-ICS has a better performance in global search, solution accuracy, and convergence speed.

abstract = {Swarm Intelligence (SI) describes the evolving collective intelligence of population/groups of autonomous agents with a low level of intelligence. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary algorithm inspired by animal social behaviour. PSO achieves performance by iteratively directing its particles toward the optimum using its social and cognitive components. Various modifications have been applied to PSO focusing on addressing a variety of methods for adjusting PSO's parameters (i.e., parameter adjustment), social interaction of the particles (i.e., neighbourhood topology) and ways to address the search objectives (i.e., sub-swarm topology). The PSO approach can easily fit in different search optimization categories such as Self Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Stochastic Search, Population- based, and Behaviour-based Search. This study addresses these principal aspects of PSO. In addition, conventional and Basic PSO are introduced and their shortcomings are discussed. Later on, various suggestions and modifications proposed by literature are introduced and discussed.},

abstract = {This paper investigates vibration characteristics of footbridge induced by crowd random walking, and presents the application of multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMD) in suppressing crowd-induced vibration. A single foot force model for the vertical component of walking-induced force is developed, avoiding the phase angle inaccessibility of the continuous walking force. Based on the single foot force model, the crowd–footbridge random vibration model, in which pedestrians are modeled as a crowd ﬂow characterized with the average time headway, is developed to consider the worst vibration state of footbridge. In this random vibration model, an analytic formulation is developed to calculate the acceleration power spectral density in arbitrary position of footbridge with arbitrary span layout. Resonant effect is observed as the footbridge natural frequencies fall within the frequency bandwidth of crowd excitation. To suppress the excessive acceleration for human normal walking comfort, a MTMD system is used to improve the footbridge dynamic characteristics. According to the random vibration model, an optimization procedure, based on the minimization of maximum root-mean-square (rms) acceleration of footbridge, is introduced to determine the optimal design parameters of MTMD system. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed MTMD designed by random optimization procedure, is more effective than traditional MTMD design methodology in reducing dynamic response during crowd–footbridge resonance, and that the proper frequency spacing enlargement will effectively reduce the off-tuning effect of MTMD.},

abstract = {In many ﬁelds one encounters the challenge of identifying, out of a pool of possible designs, those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. This means that usually there is not one optimal design but an entire set of Pareto-optimal ones with optimal tradeoﬀs in the objectives. In many applications, evaluating one design is expensive; thus, an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is unfeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the Pareto Active Learning (PAL) algorithm which intelligently samples the design space to predict the Pareto-optimal set. Key features of PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as samples from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accomodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we show an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets. The results show PAL's eﬀectiveness; in particular it improves signiﬁcantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in many cases about 33$\backslash${\%} evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.},

To handle this problem, this paper presents a parallel multi-objective particle swarm optimization where the swarm with large population size is divided into several smaller subswarms to be simultaneously optimized by different worker threads. In each subtask, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization is adopted to ﬁnish the entire evolutionary process, where the leader particles, external archive set and computational parameters are all dynamically updated. Besides, a novel constraint handling strategy is used to identify the feasible search space while the domination strategy based on constraint violation is used to enhance the convergence speed of swarm. The presented method is applied to Lancang cascade hydropower system in southwest China. The results show that PMOPSO can provide satisfying scheduling results in different cases. For the variation coefﬁcient of generation in 30 independent runs, the presented method can bettered the serial algorithm with about 66.67{\%} and 61.29{\%} reductions in normal and dry years, respectively.

abstract = {This paper presents a study on the optimal sizing of damping braces of MDOF systems equipped with viscous dampers where, unlike well-established computer-based optimisation methods, the deformability of the elastic supports is integrated by means of a novel non-iterative design tool. Mainstream optimisation methods usually focus on sizing supplemental damping devices neglecting the damper supports' ﬂexibility and therefore their effect on the overall structural damping and frequencies of vibration. In this work, the damping braces are modelled by way of viscous-elastic assemblies using the Maxwell representation. The equations of motion are formulated in the state-space representation to facilitate the assessment of the viscous-elastic assemblies' effects. The system solution presented in form of contour plots is then used as a prime tool to select the design parameters for both dampers and supporting braces, while preserving a desired level of added damping. In addition, it is shown how this approach also gives the engineer the ﬂexibility of either ﬁxing a damper size to then determine the required supporting brace stiffness or ﬁxing the supporting brace stiffness to then determine the maximum achievable damping. A case study taken from the literature is presented to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach. {\'{O}} 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pedestrian-induced vibration commonly governs serviceability criteria in footbridge design. Simplified approaches to assess these vibrations have resulted in undesirable levels of vibration in built footbridges, highlighting the need to develop more realistic representations of the pedestrian loads as well as approaches to mitigate their effects. To represent these types of loads in an accurate manner it is necessary to consider the anthropometric characteristics (inter-subject variability), the inability that pedestrians have to transmit the same force in each step (intra-subject variability), the interaction between pedestrians and the lock-in effect. It has been observed that some footbridges have experiences serviceability problems due to vibrations with excessive magnitudes. In some of these cases, the human-induced vibration cannot be controlled effectively by using conventional approaches so the use of supplemental damping devices was required. Evaluation of the dynamic response at the design stage under the most realistic representation of pedestrian is crucial to satisfying the comfort criteria. After this evaluation, in cases where the comfort criteria is not fulfilled, an option available to designers is to employ supplemental damping devices to mitigate the pedestrian-induced vibrations. This work presents a parametric study showing the high efficiency of damping devices to mitigate human-induced vibrations in girder footbridges under diverse pedestrian loading scenarios.},

The proposed technique is integrated with comprehensive learning strategy to explore the solution effectively. The performance comparison is carried out against different high quality PSO variants on the set of standard benchmark functions with and without coordinate rotation and with asymmetric initialization.

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population-based algorithm motivated by intelligent collective behavior of some animals. The most important advantages of the PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The inertia weight (w) is one of PSO's parameters originally proposed by Shi and Eberhart to bring about a balance between the exploration and exploitation characteristics of PSO. Since the introduction of this parameter, there have been a number of proposals of different strategies for determining the value of inertia weight during a course of run. This paper presents the ﬁrst comprehensive review of the various inertia weight strategies reported in the related literature. These approaches are classiﬁed and discussed in three main groups: constant, time-varying and adaptive inertia weights. A new adaptive inertia weight approach is also proposed which uses the success rate of the swarm as its feedback parameter to ascertain the particles' situation in the search space. The empirical studies on ﬁfteen static test problems, a dynamic function and a real world engineering problem show that the proposed particle swarm optimization model is quite effective in adapting the value of w in the dynamic and static environments.},

abstract = {In this paper, design sensitivity analysis methods for the transient response of nonviscously damped systems are considered. The damping forces of the non-viscously damped systems depend on the past history of motion via convolution integrals over some suitable kernel functions. The adjoint variable method (AVM) is adopted to develop the design sensitivity analysis. Two numerical solution schemes, namely the discretize-then-differentiate method and the differentiate-then-discretize method, are introduced to complete the AVM for the sensitivity analysis of non-viscously damped systems. The discretize-thendifferentiate AVM discretizes the equations of motion based on the Newmark-b implicit integration method ﬁrst and then differentiates the discrete equations. On the contrary, the differentiate-then-discretize AVM ﬁrstly differentiates the equations of motion after transforming it into a state-space form, and then discretizes the equations based on a modiﬁed precise integration method (PIM). The numerical accuracy, efﬁciency, consistency and implementation effort are discussed and compared. Two numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of both methods. The results indicate that, by considering both computational accuracy and efﬁciency, the PIM based differentiate-then-discretize method is more suitable than the Newmark-b based discretize-then-differentiate method for the sensitivity analysis of transient responses for non-viscously damped systems.},

abstract = {The interaction of walking people with large vibrating structures, such as footbridges and ﬂoors, in the vertical direction is an important yet challenging phenomenon to describe mathematically. Several different models have been proposed in the literature to simulate interaction of stationary people with vibrating structures. However, the research on moving (walking) human models, explicitly identiﬁed for vibration serviceability assessment of civil structures, is still sparse. In this study, the results of a comprehensive set of FRFbased modal tests were used, in which, over a hundred test subjects walked in different group sizes and walking patterns on a test structure. An agent-based model was used to simulate discrete trafﬁc-structure interactions. The occupied structure modal parameters found in tests were used to identify the parameters of the walking individual's singledegree-of-freedom (SDOF) mass-spring-damper model using ‘reverse engineering' methodology. The analysis of the results suggested that the normal distribution with the average of l = 2.85Hz and standard deviation of r = 0.34Hz can describe human SDOF model natural frequency. Similarly, the normal distribution with l = 0.295 and r = 0.047 can describe the human model damping ratio. Compared to the previous studies, the agent-based modelling methodology proposed in this paper offers signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in simulating multi-pedestrian walking trafﬁcs, external forces and simulating different mechanisms of human-structure and human-environment interaction at the same time.},

However, PSO has premature convergence, especially in complex multimodal functions. Extremal optimization (EO) is a recently developed local-search heuristic method and has been successfully applied to a wide variety of hard optimization problems. To overcome the limitation of PSO, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, called hybrid PSO–EO algorithm, through introducing EO to PSO. The hybrid approach elegantly combines the exploration ability of PSO with the exploitation ability of EO. We testify the performance of the proposed approach on a suite of unimodal/multimodal benchmark functions and provide comparisons with other meta-heuristics. The proposed approach is shown to have superior performance and great capability of preventing premature convergence across it comparing favorably with the other algorithms.},

abstract = {Vehicles commuting over bridge structures respond dynamically to the bridge's vibrations. An acceleration signal collected within a moving vehicle contains a trace of the bridge's structural response, but also includes other sources such as the vehicle suspension system and surface roughness-induced vibrations. This paper introduces two general methods for the bridge system identiﬁcation using data exclusively collected by a network of moving vehicles. The contributions of the vehicle suspension system are removed by deconvolving the vehicle response in frequency domain. The ﬁrst approach utilizes the vehicle transfer function, and the second uses ensemble empirical modal decomposition (EEMD). Next, roughness-induced vibrations are extracted through a novel application of second-order blind identiﬁcation (SOBI) method. After these two processes, the resulting signal is equivalent to the readings of mobile sensors that scan the bridge's dynamic response. Structural modal identiﬁcation using mobile sensor data has been recently made possible with the extended structural modal identiﬁcation using expectation maximization (STRIDEX) algorithm. The processed mobile sensor data is analyzed using STRIDEX to identify the modal properties of the bridge. The performance of the methods are validated on numerical case studies of a long single-span bridge with a network of moving vehicles collecting data while in motion. The analyses consider three road surface roughness patterns. Results show that for long-span bridges with medium- to high-ongoing trafﬁc volume, the proposed algorithms are successful in extracting pure bridge vibrations, and produce accurate and comprehensive modal properties of the bridge. The study shows that the proposed transfer function method can efﬁciently deconvolve the linear dynamics of a moving vehicle. EEMD method is able to extract vehicle dynamic response without a priori information about the vehicle. In addition, proposed identiﬁcation methods provide secondary information about the roughness pattern and the vehicle. This study is the ﬁrst proposed methodology for complete bridge modal identiﬁcation, including operational natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios using moving vehicles sensor data.},

abstract = {Three analysis methods are compared for determining the equivalent viscous damping ratios in a simple one-story, one-bay system with three different added damping conﬁgurations. The analysis methods are modal strain energy using the undamped mode shapes, free vibration log decrement, and complex eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis. The damping conﬁgurations include a diagonal conﬁguration, a horizontal conﬁguration, and a toggle-braced system. For each of these systems, a variety of linkage stiffness and damper capacities are considered. In all cases the structure, exclusive of the dampers, is assumed to remain elastic. A brief discussion is provided for the behavior of systems with nonlinear viscous dampers. The results of the study show that signiﬁcantly different values may be obtained for the effective viscous damping in the same system when different analysis approaches are used. For the toggle-braced system with relatively ﬂexible linkages, it was shown that the modal strain energy approach consistently produced increasing effective damping with increased damper capacity, while the other two methods indicated the opposite results. Subsequent analysis of the toggle-braced structure using the complex eigenvalue-eigenvector approach showed that the effective system damping was indeed decreasing with an increased device damping constant, and that the behavior could be attributed to the axial ﬂexibility of the toggle brace linkage. The analysis indicated that the greater the ﬂexibility of the linkage relative to the damping constant of the device, the greater the phase difference between the deformational velocity in the device and the relative horizontal velocity of the story containing the device. While the phase shift is evident from response history analysis, the most efﬁcient visualization tool is a plot of the damped mode shapes on a complex plane.},

However, damage identiﬁcation methods of hinge joint damage are still limited. In this study, a damage identiﬁcation algorithm for simply supported hinged-slab bridges based on the modiﬁed hinge plate method (MHPM) and artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) algorithms was proposed by considering the effect of hinge damage conditions on the lateral load distribution (LLD) of structures. Firstly, MHPM was proposed and demonstrated, which is based on a traditional hinge plate method by introducing relative displacement as a damage factor to simulate hinge joint damage. The effectiveness of MHPM was veriﬁed through comparison with the ﬁnite element method (FEM). Secondly, damage identiﬁcation was treated as the inverse problem of calculating the LLD in damage conditions of simply supported slab bridges. Four ABC algorithms were chosen to solve the problem due to its simple structure, ease of implementation, and robustness. Comparisons of convergence speed and identiﬁcation accuracy with genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization were also conducted. Finally, hinged bridges composed of four and seven slabs were studied as numerical examples to account for the feasibility and correctness of the proposed method. The simulation results revealed that the proposed algorithm could identify the location and degree of damaged joints efﬁciently and precisely.},

abstract = {The synthesis of structural health monitoring with vibration control is cost-effective and beneﬁcial for developing smart structures. In the last decade, some synthetic algorithms have been proposed for combining system identiﬁcation and vibration control. Among them, an approach has been developed recently for the synthesis of identiﬁcation and vibration control under unknown excitation. However, these approaches are only suitable when structural measurement/observation equations contain the unknown excitations, which limits the application of this approach. In this paper, a general approach is proposed to tackle this limitation problem. A generalized extended Kalman ﬁltering with unknown input (GEKF-UI) is proposed to circumvent the limitations of previous EKF-UI approaches. The proposed GEKF-UI can simultaneously identify structural system and unknown excitation when structural measurement/observation equations contain or do not contain the unknown excitations. Moreover, data fusion of measured acceleration and displacement responses is adopted to prohibit the drifts in the identiﬁed structural state and unknown excitations. Then, the identiﬁed structural state is synthesized in real time with the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control strategy for optimal semi-active optimal control provided by magneto-rheological (MR) dampers.

abstract = {The design of Tuned Mass Dampers (TMD) to satisfy serviceability requirements is becoming more and more usual in the current design of footbridges. This paper analyzes the TMD design for the mitigation of pedestrian-induced vibrations with three main objectives: the introduction of a speciﬁc TMD optimization criterion for pedestrianinduced vibrations of footbridges, a critical analysis of the applicability to this speciﬁc loading scenario of classic literature optimization criteria, and a quantiﬁcation of the TMD efﬁciency in the reduction of the footbridge acceleration. A numerical optimization criterion is proposed, based on the maximization of an efﬁciency factor, deﬁned as the ratio between the uncontrolled acceleration standard deviation and the controlled one. Optimum TMD parameters are compared with classic criteria given by the literature. A possible modiﬁcation of TMD parameters that permits to keep the TMD relative displacement within prescribed limits (aspect that is often a technical requirement in the TMD design) is also discussed. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out in order to conﬁrm the validity of the standard deviation-based optimization for the reduction of the maximum dynamic response of the bridge. An application to a real footbridge is ﬁnally presented.},

@article{Pavic2002,
abstract = {Measurement of Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) on the Millennium Bridge in London was a key part in the validation of the retrofit solution for excessive sway vibration caused by walking pedestrians during the bridge opening in June 2000. The measured FRFs were employed to verify the analytical response analysis and to estimate and confirm analytical predictions of natural frequencies, modal damping ratios, mode shapes and modal masses corresponding to various configurations of prototype viscous and tuned mass dampers. These results were used to experimentally assess the effectiveness of the proposed retrofit solution. Although FRF measurement technology is fairly standard in many engineering disciplines, its application on the Millennium Bridge was quite problematic and required some unique solutions which are described in this paper. Modal testing of the Millennium Bridge clearly demonstrated that it was possible to measure good quality FRFs around a frequency as low as 0.5 Hz, which was the natural frequency of the first lateral mode of vibration. This was achieved by designing, constructing and installing a bespoke hydraulic shaker featuring a translatory moving mass of 1000 kg. As the shaker was not able to produce perfectly sinusoidal excitation for stepped-sine testing, FRFs were successfully estimated using the so-called Resolver method in conjunction with an H c estimator. The standard H 1 FRF estimator, which is used in the vast majority of modern digital spectrum analysers nowadays, was demonstrably unable to produce meaningful FRF estimates when using the Resolver approach. The FRF estimation and curve-fitting performed in situ proved to be crucial for the success of the modal testing of the Millennium Bridge. By evaluating the estimates of the experimental FRFs and the corresponding modal properties during the testing programme on site, a number of test errors were potted. This, in turn, enabled immediate repetition of measurements and/or evaluation of the structural behaviour which would have been impossible if the FRF data analysis had been performed after the testing had been completed.},

From the dynamic measurements it was possible to conclude that: (i) the damping due to friction between ballast particles and the friction in the supports plays an important role in the evaluation of maximum accelerations and (ii) the ﬁrst natural frequencies of the bridges vary according to the amplitude of vibration, that is, increasing vibration amplitudes correspond to a decrease of the ﬁrst natural frequency in a consistent way for all investigated bridges.

A family of rheological models (classic and fractional) are used to describe the mechanical properties of the viscoelastic material. In particular, the dynamic characteristics of the structures are of interest. A numerically very efﬁcient method is proposed to determine such characteristics. The method requires the solution to the linear eigenvalue problem for corresponding elastic structures and the solution to a nonlinear, algebraic equation. The presented method is much more efﬁcient than other methods where, very often, the continuation method is used to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The inﬂuence of temperature changes on dynamic characteristics is analyzed using the frequency–temperature principle. The results of several parametric analyses are presented and discussed. For the ﬁrst time, the inﬂuence of temperature on the dynamic characteristics of beams has been studied in detail.},

abstract = {Temperature rise of an induction machine increases losses and decrease in the efﬁciency. The temperature rise depends on the machine design. It takes several hours after starting a machine to reach to thermal stability. In most of the in situ efﬁciency estimation methods, it is required to obtain the operating data of the machine at a thermally stable condition, which needs a long running time of the machine. In this paper, a method based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed, which can estimate the machine efﬁciency at different loads with thermal stability. The machine operation data at the ﬁrst 30 min after the start rather than data at a thermal stability condition are used in the method. The proposed algorithm utilizes two approaches to predict a full-load temperature at a thermally stable condition. The ﬁrst approach is based on the insulation class of the machine and uses the equivalent circuit. The second approach is based on the trend of the temperature rise in the ﬁrst 30 min of running the machine after the start. Furthermore, a method is proposed to narrow the parameters range, which helps the PSO to converge to the right answer. All results are validated by the experimental results.},

During the opening day unexpected lateral movements occurred as pedestrians crossed the bridge. The paper describes the events of opening day and the research and analysis that were carried out as a result of these movements. The lateral force exerted by pedestrians on the moving deck surface is found to be related to the movement. The results show that the phenomenon is not related to the technical innovations of the bridge and that the same phenomenon could occur on any bridge with a lateral frequency below about 1.3Hz loaded with a sufficient number of pedestrians. A selection of other bridges, including one road bridge, found to have exhibited the same phenomenon, are listed. The paper describes the development of a retrofit to control the vibrations. This involves the use of fluid-viscous dampers and tuned mass dampers to achieve damping levels in excess of 20{\%} of critical. The results of tests on the bridge with a prototype installation of a small number of the proposed dampers are presented, which show that the performance of the damping scheme conforms with analytical predictions.},

By solving an optimization problem with multiple objectives, optimized non-uniformly distributed MTMDs are obtained. Then the dynamic characteristics, effectiveness, robustness and redundancy of MTMDs are investigated in detail. Without restrictive assumptions such as uniformly distributed frequency, identical damping ratio, the optimized non-uniformly MTMDs obtained here can be considered as the ‘‘true'' optimal ones. Unlike the references [L. Zuo, S.A.

Hoang, P. Warnitchai, Design of multiple tuned mass damper by using a numerical optimizer, Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics 34(2) (2005) 125–144], the maximum displacement or frequency response of the main structure is chosen as the objective function in the present paper, because the maximum displacement is more concerned than the root-mean-square response sometimes. Using the presented method, the errors of estimate of the parameters of the structure and the MTMD can be taken into account quantitatively in the design procedure of the MTMD. It is demonstrated that the MTMDs designed in this paper are more effective than the traditional optimal uniformly distributed MTMDs whose frequency spacing, stiffness or mass and damping are under some restrictions for simplicity. And the MTMDs designed by accounting for possible errors of estimate are more robust than those without consideration of errors.},

abstract = {This paper describes the work involving the implementation of a control system aimed at reducing vibrations in a slender footbridge located at FEUP campus. This structure was extensively studied in the past, mainly due to the clear exhibition of very perceptible vibrations induced by pedestrian loads. For that reason, a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) was installed in one of the spans of the structure for research purposes. Because the structure has several critical vibration modes with natural frequencies close to 2 Hz, only one device cannot act efficiently on all of them, which limits the control efficiency. In these cases, the option for a semiactive TMD seems to be appropriate, given the self‐tuning capabilities of these devices and even the possibility of performing multimode control. In this context, this document summarizes the work developed in studying, testing, and installing the passive TMD in the footbridge, as well as its migration to a semiactive system. Taking advantage of a continuous dynamic monitoring system installed in 2009, it was possible to evaluate the vibration levels of the structure measured over the past years, including the periods previous to and after the installation of the control solutions. A tendency was noted in the reduction of the peak accelerations of some sections of the deck after the installation of the passive TMD, which were even more attenuated with the activation of the semiactive system.},

The designed bridges/viaducts are located on the main railways of the classiﬁcation coeﬃcient k = +2. A ballasted track structure adapted to high operating speeds has also been designed. The ultimate limit states and the limit states corresponding to the bridges undertaken are collected and discussed. The bridges have been designed in accordance with contemporary art engineering, with geometric and material optimization, avoiding overdesign. A new methodology of numerical modelling and simulation of dynamic processes in composite bridge/ballasted track structure/high speed train systems, developed in Part 2 and Part 3, has been applied and implemented in a problem-oriented computer programme. A new approach to predicting forced resonances in those systems is formulated and tested numerically. It has been proved that in the case of typical structural solutions of bridges and ballasted track structures, it is necessary to introduce certain limitations for operating speeds of trains.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best -known position (pbest), but is also guided toward the best -known positions (gbest) in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. The particles move in the search space with considering its own velocity and position called as pbest, but pbest has the tendency to flow around the local optima.

abstract = {The vibration of cables in a cable-supported bridge aﬀects its serviceability and safety. Therefore, cable dampers are essential for vibration control, monitoring, and the further maintenance of such bridges. In this study, the vibration control performance of an electrodynamic damper applied to a cable used in a footbridge was experimentally veriﬁed considering the major design variables of the damper. The damping performance was analyzed by varying the damping ratio according to the excitation condition and external circuit resistance. The acceleration and displacement at each measurement point and the frequency-domain response decreased. Considering the dominant response conditions of the cables in the bridge, an eﬀective additional attenuation was observed. In addition, the harvesting power considering the measurement frequency and power loss was suﬃcient to operate a wireless measuring sensor by examining the energy harvesting performance from the cable measurement data of an actual bridge in service. Finally, a stepwise operation strategy for a cable vibration monitoring system was suggested and examined by analyzing the meteorological observation data and the power output according to the wind environment. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using an electrodynamic damper to build an integrated monitoring system capable of simultaneous cable vibration reduction and energy harvesting.},

abstract = {Fatigue damage of suspenders is a main concern during the life-cycle maintenance of arch bridges and suspension bridges. This paper presents a practical framework for estimating the fatigue life of suspenders under repeated traﬃc loads by taking a three-pylon suspension bridge as an example. First, the basic theory of vehicle–bridge interaction (VBI) is introduced and a ﬁnite element model of the bridge structure is established. Second, the fatigue load spectrum is deﬁned in detail based on the analysis of WIM (weigh-in-motion) data. And then, parametric analysis is carried out to clarify the inﬂuence of road roughness, vehicle speed, and driving lanes. Among which, the time-dependent stress laws are simulated according to the deﬁned fatigue load spectrum and the stress range is counted through the Rain ﬂow counting method. At last, the fatigue life of uncorroded suspenders and naturally corroded suspenders is estimated by an S–N curve and Miner cumulative damage criterion. Results reveal that the fatigue life of suspenders is more than 100 years if no corrosion happens, while less than 20 years for short suspenders considering the inﬂuence of natural corrosion.},

abstract = {Any rational approach to define the configuration and size of viscous fluid dampers in a structure should be based on the dynamic properties of the system with the dampers. In this paper we propose an alternative representation of the complex eigenvalues of multi degree of freedom systems with dampers to calculate new equivalent natural frequencies. Analytical expressions for the dynamic properties of a two-story building model with a linear viscous damper in the first floor (i.e. with a non-proportional damping matrix) are derived. The formulas permit to obtain the equivalent damping ratios and equivalent natural frequencies for all the modes as a function of the mass, stiffness and damping coefficient for underdamped and overdamped systems. It is shown that the commonly used formula to define the equivalent natural frequency is not applicable for this type of system and for others where the damping matrix is not proportional to the mass matrix, stiffness matrix or both. Moreover, the new expressions for the equivalent natural frequencies expose a novel phenomenon; the use of viscous fluid dampers can modify the vibration frequencies of the structure. The significance of the new equivalent natural frequencies is expounded by means of a simulated free vibration test. The proposed approach may offer a new perspective to study the effect of viscous dampers on the dynamic properties of a structure.},

abstract = {Passive energy devices are well known due to their performance for vibration control in buildings subjected to dynamic excitations. Tuned mass damper (TMD) is one of the oldest passive devices, and it has been very much used for vibration control in buildings around the world. However, the best parameters in terms of stiffness and damping and the best position of the TMD to be installed in the structure are an area that has been studied in recent years, seeking optimal designs of such device for attenuation of structural dynamic response. Thus, in this work, a new methodology for simultaneous optimization of parameters and positions of multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) in buildings subjected to earthquakes is proposed. It is important to highlight that the proposed optimization methodology considers uncertainties present in the structural parameters, in the dynamic load, and also in the MTMD design with the aim of obtaining a robust design; that is, a MTMD design that is not sensitive to the variations of the parameters involved in the dynamic behavior of the structure. For illustration purposes, the proposed methodology is applied in a 10-story building, confirming its effectiveness. Thus, it is believed that the proposed methodology can be used as a promising tool for MTMD design.},

abstract = {The paper presents an analytical approach to the problem of vehicle-bridge dynamic interaction. Starting from early studies based on a simply supported beam interacting with a lumped mass moving at constant speed, in recent years researchers have improved the models of both the bridge and the vehicle. On this basis, the bridge is modelled here as a multi-span continuous isotropic plate; its response to external loads is defined by applying the mode superposition principle and takes into account both flexural and torsional mode shapes, the latter being usually neglected in the literature. The plate is considered proportionally damped and its modes are computed by means of the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The scheme adopted for the vehicle consists of a seven degrees-of-freedom system moving at constant speed over the isotropic rough bridge surface. The numerical investigation, based on these analytical models, refers to a three-span bridge and includes the importance of torsional mode shapes, of road surface irregularities and of vehicle speed. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

This work presents a case study of optimizing an integrated distributed energy system consisting of combined heat and power (CHP), photovoltaics (PV), and electric and/or thermal energy storage for a hospital and large hotel buildings located in Texas and California. First, simulation models for all subsystems, which are developed individually, are integrated together according to a control strategy designed to satisfy both the electric and thermal energy requirements of a building. Subsequently, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is employed to obtain an optimal design of each subsystem. The objectives of the optimization are to minimize the simple payback period (PBP) and maximize the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (RCDE). Finally, the energy performance for the selected building types and locations are analyzed after the optimization. Results indicate that the proposed optimization method could be applied to determine an optimal design of distributed energy systems, which reaches a trade-off between the economic and environmental performance for different buildings. With the presented distributed energy system, a peak shaving in electricity of about 300 kW and a reduction in boiler fuel consumption of 610 kW could be attained for the hospital building located in California for a winter day. For the summer and transition seasons, electricity peak shaving of 800 kW and 600 kW could be achieved, respectively.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the formulation of a sequencing problem with the dual goals of varying the parts utilization at different workstations of the assembly line and varying the workload associated with each workstation; these two objectives are typically inversely correlated with each other, and therefore the simultaneous optimization of both is challenging. Owing to the NP-hardness of the problem, this paper introduces a Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) algorithm, a Memetic Algorithm (MA), a Weighted sum Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGAW), and a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve a just-in-time sequencing problem where these objectives are to be optimized simultaneously. The performance of these algorithms is compared against each other on small, medium, and large problems. According to statistical analysis, experimental results show that discrete particle swarm optimization outperforms the other algorithms in respect of a comparison metric.},

abstract = {A model is developed to predict bending vibrations of flood gates with fluid on both sides. The liquid flow is three-dimensional and the gate is represented as a thin plate. The fluid response is considered within the linear potential flow theory including the effect of compressibility and the generation of free surface waves. This way, the hydrodynamic fluid pressure exerted on the gate is predicted accurately in both low and high-frequency regimes. Both the structural and fluid responses are expressed in the modal domain as a superposition of modes. A semi-analytical solution of the fluid-interaction problem is obtained by describing the complete system in terms of in vacuo gate modes, which is computationally efficient compared to existing numerical methods. This allows for the accurate prediction of flood gate vibrations for a large number of simulations, making it possible to perform fatigue calculations and probabilistic evaluations. The case of a typical flat flood gate subjected to an impulsive wave impact is studied with the developed model. Results show the capability of the model to efficiently quantify flood gate vibrations considering the involved fluid-structure interaction, which can lead to more economical designs compared to common engineering practice.},

With substructuring methods, a global structure is divided into a number of independent substructures. Only the substructures are repeatedly analyzed and the re-analysis of the global structure is thereby avoided. This article reviews widely used dynamic substructuring methods for model updating and damage identification of large-scale structures. These methods can be categorized into forward and inverse substructuring approaches. The former is a conventional process that assembles the vibration properties of each substructure to obtain the vibration properties of the global structure. The latter, on the contrary, disassembles the vibration properties of the global structure into those of the substructures. In each category, both frequency and time domain methods have been developed and will be reviewed.},

abstract = {The dynamic characteristics of a multi-span pre-stressed concrete urban bridge before, during and after widening operations have been studied. The widening operations have been carried out by adding two new bridges on the either sides of the old bridge. The decks of the new bridges have been structurally separated from the old one by two longitudinal joints on the either side of the old bridge. The dynamic characteristics have been extracted from operational modal tests in three phases during different stages of the widening operations. The dynamic interaction between the new parts and the old part of the bridge has also been investigated. The results show that after the completion of the widening works, and when the whole bridge was placed in service condition, this interaction affects the natural frequencies of almost all the vibration modes of the bridge. It was also found that the longitudinal joints were unable to effectively isolate the new parts from the old part. Finally, in order to achieve a consistent behaviour in the first bending mode of the new and old bridges, a geometrical index has been introduced. This index includes both the effects of stiffness and mass properties of the bridge deck. In widening projects, where the span lengths, material properties and support conditions of the two bridges are taken the same, adopting equal geometrical indices leads to almost equal values of the natural frequencies and similar mode shapes in the first bending mode. The proposed index can be used in the initial design stage for such projects.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary heuristics-based method used for continuous function optimization. PSO is stochastic yet very robust. Nevertheless, real-world optimizations require a high computational effort to converge to a good solution for the problem. In general, parallel PSO implementations provide good performance. However, this depends heavily on the parallelization strategy used as well as the number and characteristics of the exploited processors. In this paper, we propose a cooperative strategy, which consists of subdividing an optimization problem into many simpler sub-problems. Each of these focuses on a distinct subset of the problem dimensions. The optimization work for all the selected sub-problems is done in parallel. We map the work onto four different parallel high-performance multiprocessors, which are based on multi- and many-core architectures. The performance of the strategy thus implemented is evaluated for four well known benchmark functions with high-dimension and different complexity. The obtained speedups are compared to that yielded by a serial PSO implementation.},

Modal testing is a useful tool in understanding the dynamic behavior of structures. However, modal tests are not conducted on bladed disks because of the difficulties involved. One problem is that the overall dynamic behavior is sensitive to small perturbations. Another problem is that multiple inputs and high-resolution techniques are required to separate modes that are nearly repeated. Two studies of engine blade response were recently completed in which bench modal tests were successfully performed on simplified fan models. The modal test procedures for the first study were successful in extracting the modal parameters. But the tests in the second study were more demanding. Ultimately, an approach was devised that accurately extracted the modal parameters. This paper describes the challenges and the evolution of the test procedures.},

This paper proposes a parameter optimization method for dynamic vibration absorbers and seeks parameters of a dynamic vibration absorber with better vibration suppression performance. Firstly, the frequency response function of the dynamic vibration absorber-rotor coupling system is obtained by using the finite element method. Then, basing on the optimal mathematical model, the optimal design variables are solved with the adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm. Also, an example is used to prove the validity of the optimization design method mentioned in this paper. Further, in order to master the influence of deviation from the optimal value on the suppressing vibration effect, the vibration suppression performance changes of the dynamic vibration absorber whose parameters deviate from the optimal value are analyzed. The results show that: compared with conventional design method, this method is more superior; The dynamic vibration absorber with optimal parameters has better vibration suppression performance; At the same degree deviated from the optimal value, the stiffness has a more remarkable influence on the vibration suppression performance than damping for suppressing the first resonance; For the dynamic vibration absorber which is adopted to suppress the fixed-frequency vibration, the influence of stiffness deviation on the vibration suppression performance appears an obvious interval which is related to working speed.},

abstract = {To evaluate different energy dissipation systems used to control wind-induced vibrations of a 456 m super-tall building in fluctuating wind excitations, the finite element (FE) method was employed to simulate the dynamic responses of the building. A series of wind tunnel pressure tests were conducted on a 1:450 scale model to determine the wind forces acting on the super-tall building. A FE model was also constructed and mass, damping and stiffness matrices were subsequently formulated as an evaluation model for numerical analysis. The evaluation model was further simplified to a state reduced-order system using the state order reduction method. Three different vibration control schemes, namely a tuned mass damper (TMD) system, a system containing only nonlinear viscous dampers and a hybrid control system combining TMD and viscous dampers, were examined through simulations with respect to their effectiveness in reducing the accelerations at the top of the building. Furthermore, a cost evaluation was conducted to determine the most economical structural design and vibration control scheme. The results show that the wind-induced vibrations of the analysed building can be controlled effectively by all the three examined schemes, while the hybrid control scheme and the scheme containing only viscous dampers further reduce the wind-induced vibration to satisfy a more stringent criterion for a six-star hotel. In addition, the hybrid vibration control scheme is also the most cost-effective among the examined schemes.},

abstract = {The application of active structural control technology to highway bridge structures subjected to high-impact loadings is investigated. The effects of high-impact loads on infrastructure, like heavy vehicle collisions with bridge piers, have not been studied as much as seismic load effects on structures. Due to this lack of research regarding impact loads and structural control, a focused study on the application of active control devices to infrastructure after impact events can provide valuable results and conclusions. This research applies active structural control to an idealized two-span, continuous girder, concrete highway bridge structure. The idealization of a highway bridge structure as a two degree-of-freedom structural system is used to investigate the effectiveness of control devices installed between the bridge pier and deck, the two degrees of freedom. The control devices are fixed to bracing between the bridge pier and girders and controlled by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The PID control gains are optimized by both the Ziegler-Nichols ultimate sensitivity method (USM) and a new method for this impact load application called particle swarm optimization (PSO). The controlled time-domain responses are compared to the uncontrolled responses, and the effectiveness of PID control, USM optimization, and PSO is compared for this control device configuration. The results of this investigation show PID control to be effective for minimizing both superstructure and substructure responses of highway bridges after high-impact loads. Deck response reductions of greater than 19$\backslash${\%} and 37$\backslash${\%} were seen for displacement and acceleration responses, respectively, regardless of the performance index used to analyze them. PSO was much more effective than USM optimization for tuning PID control gains.},

abstract = {In this paper, a fast and effective CFD-based automatic loop for optimization of rotorcraft components is presented. The automatic loop is strictly designed around an innovative Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) developed at University of Padua, namely the GeDEA-II. This algorithm allows performing multi-objective, multi-point optimization works in a fast and robust way. It combines novel crossover and mutation operators when compared to other state-of-the-art MOEA. Recent papers show its excellent performance when tested on state-of-the-art problems. In order to test the performance of this algorithm, two test cases are presented, each having peculiar characteristics making them even harder to solve. Test cases regard the aerodynamic shape optimization of ERICA components, that is an innovative tilt-rotor concept conceived and designed recently. The first problem regards the single-objective, multi-constrained aerodynamic optimization of the ERICA tilt-rotor cockpit region. The second one is a multi-objective multi-constrained optimization of the ERICA landing gear sponsons. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this automatic optimization loop in tackling real-world engineering problems.},

abstract = {In Japan, the seismic behavior of the bridge structures is a much under-researched area of the civil engineering field since bridges have enormous importance and number for providing connection between the scattered islands. In this sense seismic design and analysis methods are paid much attention to get optimum behavior under severe earthquakes during bridge service life. In this paper, the retrofitting process of an existed upper-deck type steel arch bridge located in the Ground Type I which include good diluvial ground and rock is investigated. Since the bridge has been designed by the old code of 1980, it is in need of retrofitting. As a first step of dynamic response analysis, the dynamic characteristics along both longitudinal and transverse directions are analyzed by eigenvalue analysis to figure out the natural behavior under the dead load. The nonlinear dynamic response analysis is conducted under Hyogoken Nanbu earthquake occurred in 1995. After detecting the critical sections as abutments the viscous dampers are installed to increase the seismic performance of the bridge under severe earthquakes. The comparative results between undamped and damped structures are presented in terms of acceleration and displacement values at the critical points to evaluate the advantages of dampers. By this research, an application of seismic retrofitting and isolation methods are presented.},

abstract = {The advent of high-speed railways has raised many concerns regarding the behaviour of bridges. Particularly, the analysis of the free vibrations generated by each load is of great interest because they can possibly accumulate and create resonance phenomena. Regarding simply supported beams, earlier contributions showed that the free vibrations created by a single moving force are of maximum or zero amplitude (cancellation) for certain speeds. In the present paper new closed-form expressions are given for the cancellation speeds of a generic mode, as well as for the most representative points of maximum amplitude. Similar new results are provided for elastically supported beams as well. A simpler, closed-form approximate expression of the cancellation condition for an elastically supported beam is also derived from the analysis of a single passing load; this approximate formula is in good agreement with the exact results. Knowing a priori the speeds of maximum free vibrations or cancellation is of great interest for experimental tests on bridges, particularly as regards the evaluation of amplitudedependent magnitudes such as structural damping. Regarding the resonance phenomena, if the resonance speeds coincide with either a maximum free vibration or a cancellation speed, then a maximum resonance or a cancellation of resonance will occur. The most relevant cases thereof have been investigated, and new expressions which allow predicting them for a generic mode are given. Finally, a new approximate formula is proposed for estimating the maximum acceleration of simply supported bridges caused by resonances of the fundamental mode. After extensive numerical testing, the formula has proved to be a useful tool for a ﬁrst assessment of simply supported bridges according to building codes such as Eurocodes.},

abstract = {Dissipative mechanisms in linear multiple-degree-of-freedom viscoelastic systems are characterized by the dependence on the history of the velocity degrees-of-freedom via convolution integrals over kernel functions. As a result, damping matrices are frequencydependent and, in general, state-space approach based methods are widely used for their resolution. This paper proposes a new approach suitable for modelling such systems via a viscous model with proportional damping, which approximates the response of the original viscoelastic system using the undamped eigenvectors together with the complex eigenvalues with oscillatory nature, neglecting those modes with non-viscous nature (negative real eigenvalues). It is rigorously demonstrated that the transfer function of any viscoelastic system can be expanded as the sum of the transfer function of certain viscous model and a residual term. The obtained viscous model, named Equivalent Viscous Model, is characteristic of each viscoelastic system. In order to study the bound of the residual term two indexes are introduced to describe, on one hand, the non-proportionality, or the modal decoupling capability of the damping matrix and, on the other hand, the damping level of the system. The proposed viscous model is validated through numerical examples simulating different conditions of proportionality and damping.},

At present, MOPs with large numbers of variables and many objectives (greater than or equal to four) are constantly emerging. When tackling this type of MOPs, the traditional multi-objective PSO algorithms have low efficiency. Aiming at these multi-objective large-scale optimization problems (MOLSOPs) and many-objective large-scale optimization problems (MaOLSOPs), we need to explore thoroughly parallel attributes of the particle swarm, and design the novel PSO algorithms according to the characteristics of distributed parallel computation. We survey the related research on PSO: multi-objective large-scale optimization, many-objective optimization, and distributed parallelism. Based on the aforementioned three aspects, the multi-objective large-scale distributed parallel PSO and many-objective large-scale distributed parallel PSO methodologies are proposed and discussed, and the other future research trends are also illuminated.},

abstract = {Function evaluations (FEs) of many real-world optimization problems are time or resource consuming, posing a serious challenge to the application of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to solve these problems. To address this challenge, the research on surrogate-assisted EAs has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry over the past decades. However, most existing surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs) either still require thousands of expensive FEs to obtain acceptable solutions, or are only applied to very low-dimensional problems. In this paper, a novel surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimization (PSO) inspired from committee-based active learning (CAL) is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, a global model management strategy inspired from CAL is developed, which searches for the best and most uncertain solutions according to a surrogate ensemble using a PSO algorithm and evaluates these solutions using the expensive objective function. In addition, a local surrogate model is built around the best solution obtained so far. Then, a PSO algorithm searches on the local surrogate to ﬁnd its optimum and evaluates it. The evolutionary search using the global model management strategy switches to the local search once no further improvement can be observed, and vice versa. This iterative search process continues until the computational budget is exhausted. Experimental results comparing the proposed algorithm with a few state-of-the-art SAEAs on both benchmark problems up to 30 decision variables as well as an airfoil design problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve better or competitive solutions with a limited budget of hundreds of exact FEs.},

From this perspective, the paper shows a methodology based on the well known state-space representation of dynamical systems to calculate the modal damping ratios of non classical/non proportional damping schemes. The methodology is then adopted to analyse a number of design methods for supplemental damping systems found in the scientific literature. The analysis shows that many design methods yield a similar result of implicitly suggesting a 1st modal damping ratio of about 20{\%}. The same methodology is also adopted to show that the contribution of higher modes is generally negligible in designing a supplemental damping system and that the required damping level can be typically obtained with a limited number of supplemental devices.},

abstract = {While numerous studies have been published concerning the application of a variety of system identification techniques in conjunction with vibration measurements from civil infrastructure systems, there is a paucity of publications addressing the influence of algorithm-specific control parameters that impact the correct and efficient application of the selected identification scheme. Furthermore, as dense sensor arrays become widely accessible in civil infrastructure applications, voluminous amounts of multichannel data streams are becoming available for processing, thus imposing new demands on identification procedures regarding high-dimensionality (in both the spatial as well as the temporal domains) requirements that may render some methods inapplicable if careful attention is not paid to practical implementation issues. This paper provides a comprehensive study of three time-domain identification algorithms applied in conjunction with the Natural Excitation Technique in order to extract the modal parameters of a newly constructed long-span bridge that was monitored, in its virgin state, over a relatively long period of time with a state-of-the-art dense sensor array. The three methods used are: the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), the ERA with data correlations, and the least squares algorithm. One of the critical issues in the mentioned algorithms, is selection of the reference degree-of-freedom (DOF). Previous experiences have shown that one cannot rely on a single reference DOF for identification of all modes. Consequently, the aforementioned identification formulations were modified to include multiple reference DOF, simultaneously, or one at a time. An autonomous algorithm was presented to distinguish the genuine structural modes from spurious noise or computational modes. Based on some parameter studies, some useful guidelines for the selection of critical user-selectable parameters are presented. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

abstract = {The finite element (FE) model updating technology was originally developed in the aerospace and mechanical engineering disciplines to automatically update numerical models of structures to match their experimentally measured counterparts. The process of updating identifies the drawbacks in the FE modelling and the updated FE model could be used to produce more reliable results in further dynamic analysis. In the last decade, the updating technology has been introduced into civil structural engineering. It can serve as an advanced tool for getting reliable modal properties of large structures. The updating process has four key phases: initial FE modelling, modal testing, manual model tuning and automatic updating (conducted using specialist software). However, the published literature does not connect well these phases, although this is crucial when implementing the updating technology. This paper therefore aims to clarify the importance of this linking and to describe the complete model updating process as applicable in civil structural engineering. The complete process consisting the four phases is outlined and brief theory is presented as appropriate. Then, the procedure is implemented on a lively steel box girder footbridge. It was found that even a very detailed initial FE model underestimated the natural frequencies of all seven experimentally identified modes of vibration, with the maximum error being almost 30{\%}. Manual FE model tuning by trial and error found that flexible supports in the longitudinal direction should be introduced at the girder ends to improve correlation between the measured and FE-calculated modes. This significantly reduced the maximum frequency error to only 4{\%}. It was demonstrated that only then could the FE model be automatically updated in a meaningful way. The automatic updating was successfully conducted by updating 22 uncertain structural parameters. Finally, a physical interpretation of all parameter changes is discussed. This interpretation is often missing in the published literature. It was found that the composite slabs were less stiff than originally assumed and that the asphalt layer contributed considerably to the deck stiffness.},

abstract = {Wind and seismic resistance design are two critical elements in structural design of long-span cable stayed bridges. In order to investigate the inﬂuences of the originally equipped seismic viscous dampers on the wind-resistant performance of bridges, full bridge aeroelastic wind tunnel tests have been carried out on the overall scaled model of Hangzhou Bay Cable Stayed Bridge. It is found that the bridge exhibits good wind-resistant performance, while seismic viscous dampers have very minor effects on the vertical buffeting displacement of the mid-span girder. The study also shows that optimizing the damper parameters could only slightly improve the ability of the dampers to reduce wind vibrations. Therefore, when designing long span cable stayed bridges, the bridge seismic design and wind-resistant design can be carried out separately, without considering the wind-resistant effects of the dampers which aim at dissipating earthquake energy.},

abstract = {This paper is aimed at extending classical modal analysis to treat lumped-parameter nonviscously damped linear dynamic systems. It is supposed that the damping forces depend on the past history of velocities via convolution integrals over some kernel functions. The traditional restriction of symmetry has not been imposed on the system matrices. The nature of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is discussed under certain simpliﬁed but physically realistic assumptions concerning the system matrices and kernel functions. A numerical method for calculation of the right and left eigenvectors is suggested. The transfer function matrix of the system is derived in terms of the right and left eigenvectors of the second-order system. Exact closed-form expressions for the dynamic response due to general forces and initial conditions are presented. The proposed method uses neither the state-space approach nor additional dissipation coordinates. Suitable examples are given to illustrate the derived results.},

@article{Bocian2018,
abstract = {A multi-scale and multi-object interaction phenomena can arise when a group of walking pedestrians crosses a structure capable of exhibiting dynamic response. This is because each pedestrian is an autonomous dynamic system capable of displaying intricate behaviour affected by social, psychological, biomechanical and environmental factors, including adaptations to the structural motion. Despite a wealth of mathematical models attempting to describe and simulate coupled crowd-structure system, their applicability can generally be considered uncertain. This can be assigned to a number of assumptions made in their development and the scarcity or unavailability of data suitable for their validation, in particular those associated with pedestrian-pedestrian and pedestrian-structure interaction. To alleviate this problem, data on behaviour of individual pedestrians within groups of six walkers with different spatial arrangements are gathered simultaneously with data on dynamic structural response of a footbridge, from a series of measurements utilising wireless motion monitors. Unlike in previous studies on coordination of pedestrian behaviour, the collected data can serve as a proxy for pedestrian vertical force, which is of critical importance from the point of view of structural stability. A bivariate analysis framework is proposed and applied to these data, encompassing wavelet transform, synchronisation measures based on Shannon entropy and circular statistics. A topological pedestrian map is contrived showing the strength and directionality of between-subjects interactions. It is found that the coordination in pedestrians' vertical force depends on the spatial collocation within a group, but it is generally weak. The relationship between the bridge and pedestrian behaviour is also analysed, revealing stronger propensity for pedestrians to coordinate their force with the structural motion rather than with each other.},

@article{Siringoringo2008,
abstract = {The paper addresses and evaluates the application of system identification to a suspension bridge using ambient vibration response. To obtain dynamic characteristics of the bridge, two output-only time-domain system identification methods are employed namely, the Random Decrement Method combined with the Ibrahim Time Domain (ITD) method and the Natural Excitation Technique (NExT) combined with the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA). Accuracy and efficiency of both methods are investigated, and compared with the results from a Finite Element Model. The results of system identification demonstrate that using both methods, ambient vibration measurement can provide reliable information on dynamic characteristics of the bridge. The NExT-ERA technique, however, is more practical and efficient especially when applied to voluminous data from multi-channel measurement. The results from three days of measurements indicate the wind-velocity dependency of natural frequency and damping ratio particularly for low-order modes. The sources of these dependencies appear to be the effect of aerodynamic forces alongside the girder, and friction force from the bearing near the towers. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Structural systems are under deterioration due to ageing, mechanical stressors, and harsh environment, among other threats. Corrosion and fatigue can cause gradual structural deterioration. Moreover, natural and man-made hazards may lead to a sudden drop in the structural performance. Inspection and maintenance actions are performed to monitor the structural safety and maintain the performance over certain thresholds. However, these actions must be effectively planned throughout the life-cycle of a system to ensure the optimum budget allocation and maximum possible service life without adverse effects on the structural system safety. Life-cycle engineering provides rational means to optimise life-cycle aspects, starting from the initial design and construction to dismantling and replacing the system at the end of its service life. This paper presents a brief overview of the recent research achievements in the field of life-cycle engineering for civil and marine structural systems and indicates future directions in this research field. Several aspects of life-cycle engineering are presented, including the performance prediction under uncertainty and optimisation of life-cycle cost and intervention activities, as well as the role of structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing techniques in supporting the life-cycle management decisions. Risk, resilience, sustainability, and their integration into the life-cycle management are also discussed.},

abstract = {Studies on vibration control of stay cables in cable-stayed bridges have been keenly interested by researchers and engineers in designing new bridges and assessing in-service bridges. Mitigation of undesired cable vibration can be achieved by attaching a damping device. A Viscous Mass Damper (VMD) is composed by the arrangement a rotational Viscous Damper (VD) and an inertial mass element in parallel, which has been used to control seismic in many buildings in Japan; however, it has not been studied to apply in field of cable vibration control. This paper proposes the application of VMD to robustness in suppressing cable vibration. Oscillation parameters of the cable-VMD system are investigated in detail using an analytical formulation of the complex eigenvalue problem and compared with Viscous Damper (VD). Asymptotic formulas to calculate the complex eigenvalue solutions and the damping ratios of the cable with VMD installed in the proximity of the cable end are proposed, discussed and compared with the exact solutions. Further, the influence of elastic support on the VMD effectiveness of a cable-VMD system is analyzed and examined. Lastly, a case study is provided to justify the proposed methodology. The results of this study show that VMD can improve the cable damping ratio more efficiently than VD where the maximum damping ratio of VMD is larger than that of VD, and the increased damping ratio is higher when the relative modes are higher. The paper also provides necessary insights into the dynamics of the cable-VMD system and a useful tool for selecting optimal parameters of VMD for stay cables.},

The designed and produced footbridge span is durable, dynamically resistant, incombustible, easy to install and maintain, resistant to weather conditions and also aesthetically interesting. For footbridge production environmentally friendly PET foam core may be used. It may come from recycling of used plastic packages and which is produced with less energy consumption process and much less CO2 emission.

This problem is of considerable practical interest in the context of stay-cable vibration suppression in bridges. An expression for the eigenvalues is derived that is independent of the damper coefﬁcient, giving the range of attainable modal damping ratios and corresponding oscillation frequencies in every mode for a given damper location without approximation. This formulation reveals the importance of damper-induced frequency shifts in characterizing the response of the system. New regimes of behavior are observed when these frequency shifts are large, as is the case in higher modes and for damper locations further from the end of the cable. For a damper located sufﬁciently near the antinode in a given mode, a regime of solutions is identiﬁed for which the damping approaches critical as the damper coefﬁcient approaches a critical value. A regime diagram is developed to indicate the type of behavior in each mode for any given damper location.},

abstract = {Guy cables are frequently used to support vertical axis wind turbines since guying the turbine reduces some of the structural requirements on the tower. The guys must be designed to provide both the required strength and the required stiffness at the top of the turbine. The axial load which the guys apply to the tower, bearings, and foundations is an undesirable consequence of using guys to support the turbine. Limiting the axial load so that it does not significantly affect the cost of the turbine is an important objective of the cable design. The lateral vibration of the cables is another feature of the cable design which needs to be considered. These aspects of the cable design are discussed in this paper, and a technique for damping cable vibrations is mathematically analyzed and demonstrated with experimental data.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the applicability of multiple tuned mass dampers ͑MTMDs͒ to suppress train-induced vibration on bridges. A railway bridge is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam and a train is simulated as a series of moving forces, moving masses, or moving suspension masses. According to the train load frequency analysis, resonant effects will occur as the modal frequencies of a bridge are close to the multiple of the impact frequency of the train load to the bridge. An MTMD system is then designed to alter the bridge dynamic characteristics to avoid excessive vibrations. Numerical results from simply supported bridges of the Taiwan High-Speed Railway ͑THSR͒ under real trains show that the proposed MTMD is more effective and reliable than a single TMD in reducing dynamic responses during resonant speeds, as the train axle arrangement is regular. It is also found that the inner space of a bridge box-girder of the THSR is wide and deep enough for installation and movement of MTMDs.},

abstract = {Modal tests on large structures are often performed in multiple setups for practical reasons. Several sensors are kept fixed as reference sensors over all setups, while the other, so called roving sensors, are moved from one setup to another. This paper develops an optimal sensor placement strategy for multi-setup modal identification, which simultaneously optimizes the locations of the reference sensors and roving sensors. As an optimality criterion, the Information Entropy is adopted, which is a scalar measure of uncertainty in the Bayesian framework. The focus in the application goes to repetitive structures where modes typically occur in clusters, with closely spaced natural frequencies and similar wavelengths. The proposed strategy is illustrated for selecting optimal positions of uni-axial sensors for a repetitive frame structure. The influence of the number of reference sensors and two strategies for positioning roving sensors, i.e. a cluster and a uniform distribution of roving sensors, are investigated. The number of reference sensors is found to be preferably equal to or larger than the number of modes to be identified. In this case, the information content, as quantified by the Information Entropy, is not very sensitive to the roving sensor strategy. If less reference sensors are used, it is highly preferred to distribute the roving sensors uniformly over the structure instead of clustering them. The proposed strategy has been validated by an experimental modal test on a floor of an office building of KU Leuven, which has a nearly repetitive structural layout. The results show how optimally locating sensors allows extracting more information from the data. Though the focus is on applications involving repetitive structures, the proposed strategy can be applied to multi-setup modal identification of any large structure.},

abstract = {A modal-based global method for identiﬁcation, localization and quantiﬁcation of damage of a shear frame structure is presented in this paper. The method involves identiﬁcation of modal parameters from the vibration responses of the structure only (output only) using a combination of natural excitation technique (NExT) and eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), and determination of stiffness parameters using very few identiﬁed modes by employing a least squares solution procedure. Finally, damage is indicated by comparing the stiffnesses of the (possibly) damaged structure with that of the undamaged structure. The implementation of NExT–ERA requires a reference channel for modal identiﬁcation, but several limitations of using a single reference channel have been identiﬁed from the investigations of this study. To overcome the limitations, a new approach called multi-reference-based mode selection is proposed in this paper. The approach makes use of all the available DOFs, but one at a time, as reference channels and identiﬁes the best representative modes of the structure by a mode screening process and a mode separation process. The approach is also automated for expediency and possible real-time application. The presented damage detection methodology is implemented on the analytical phase I and experimental phase II of the IASC-ASCE SHM benchmark problem and shows an accuracy of around 90{\%} in damage detection.

abstract = {Many real-world decision problems consider more than one objective. These objectives usually con ict with each other. In the problem environments, many data and parameters are usually uncertain at the time of planning. So multiobjective optimization combined with uncertainty is a challenging research topic. To deal with the basic search process in such problems, in this paper, a new approach has been proposed that combines multiple population based algorithms under a single algorithm structure. To deal with the uncertainty, a dynamic scenario-based approach is developed and integrated with the search process, in which the number of scenarios is dynamically set during the solution process. This is a new way of solving multi-objective optimization problems under uncertainty. To judge the performance of the proposed approach, we have solved a set of standard test problems without uncertainty and a number of practical problems with uncertainty. The practical problems are the well-known dynamic economic and emission dispatch problems, with di erent combinations of energy sources. The experimental studies demonstrated that the proposed approach performs better than other well-known algorithms compared in this paper.},

abstract = {This paper describes a historical arch bridge; its analytical modelling, modal testing and finite element model (FEM) updating. For this purpose, Senyuva historical arch bridge which is built in 1696 and located in Camlihemsin, Rize, Turkey, is selected as an application. 3D FEM of the bridge is modelled using ANSYS software to obtain analytical dynamic characteristics such as natural frequencies and mode shapes. Then, operational modal analysis using ambient vibrations is performed to attain dynamic characteristics experimentally. Human walking and wind are used as natural excitation. The output-only modal parameter identification is carried out using the Peak Picking method in frequency domain and the Stochastic Subspace Identification method in time domain. After, analytically and experimentally identified dynamic characteristics compared with each other and FEM of the historical bridge is updated to minimize the differences between modal parameters by changing uncertain modelling parameters such as boundary conditions. As a result, differences between the natural frequencies are reduced from 27{\%} to 3{\%} and good agreement is found between analytical and experimental dynamic characteristics after FEM updating.

abstract = {A concept for the optimization of nonlinear functions using particle swarm methodology is introduced. The evolution of several paradigms is outlined, and an implementation of one of the paradigms is discussed. Benchmark testing of the paradigm is described, and applications, including nonlinear function optimization and neural network training, are proposed. The relationships between particle swarm optimization and both artificial life and genetic algorithms are described, 1 INTRODUCTION This paper introduces a method for optimization of continuous nonlinear functions. The method was discovered through simulation of a simplified social model; thus the social metaphor is discussed, though the algorithm stands without metaphorical support. This paper describes the particle swarm optimization concept in terms of its precursors, briefly reviewing the stages of its development from social simulation to optimizer. Discussed next are a few paradigms that implement the concept. Finally, the implementation of one paradigm is discussed in more detail, followed by results obtained from applications and tests upon which the paradigm has been shown to perform successfully.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has two salient components: 1) a dynamical rule governing particle motion and 2) an interparticle communication topology. Recent practice has focused on the fully connected topology (Gbest) despite earlier indications on the superiority of local particle neighborhoods. This paper seeks to address the controversy with empirical trials with canonical PSO on a large benchmark of functions, categorized into 14 properties. This paper confirms the early lore that Gbest is the overall better algorithm for unimodal and separable problems and that a ring neighborhood of connectivity two (Lbest) is the preferred choice for multimodal, nonseparable and composition functions. Topologies of intermediate particle connectivity were also tested and the difference in global/local performance was found to be even more marked. A measure of significant improvement is introduced in order to distinguish major improvements from refinements. Lbest, according to the experiments on the 84 test functions and a bi-modal problem of adjustable severity, is found to have significant improvements later in the run, and to be more diverse at termination. A mobility study shows that Lbest is better able to jump between optimum basins. Indeed Gbest was unable to switch basins in the bi-modal trial. The implication is that Lbest's larger terminal diversity, its better ability to basin hop and its later significant improvement account for the performance enhancement. In several cases where Lbest was not the better algorithm, the trials show that Lbest was not stuck but would have continued to improve with an extended evaluation budget. Canonical PSO is a baseline algorithm and the ancestor of all contemporary PSO variants. These variants build on the basic structure of baseline PSO and the broad conclusions of this paper are expected to follow through. In particular, research that fails to consider local topologies risks underplaying the success of the promoted algorithm.},

abstract = {A novel Cooperative Bee Swarm Optimization (CBSO) algorithm based on foraging behaviour of honey bees is presented. The CBSO employs cooperative behaviours of multiple swarms in optimizing numerical functions. The proposed approach provides different patterns which are used by the bees to adjust their flying trajectories. The flying patterns provide an efficient way to balance exploration and exploitation. Cooperation is obtained by sharing information between swarms through a leader swarm. Also, a colonization process is performed between swarms. In colonization process a portion of an extinct swarm is replaced with the individuals from a colonist swarm. The proposed algorithm was tested on a set of well-known test functions. Results have shown that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and outperforms other genetic, particle swarm, and bee algorithms examined in this paper.},

abstract = {Abstract Vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) comprises a promising set of techniques for damage detection and health monitoring of civil engineering structures. However, the successful application of these methods to real structures is still a challenging task, due primarily to the large size of such structures and the relatively high levels of variability in their dynamic response under operational load conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the application of VBDD techniques, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness for identifying and locating low damage levels and improving their applicability to the continuous or periodic health monitoring of structures. The basic features of the methodology include the use of a controlled and consistent excitation force, the use of operational deflection shapes (ODSs) at all measured frequency increments rather than only at natural frequencies, the use of a logarithmic scale for representing the ODS amplitudes at each frequency increment and the establishment of a threshold level for damage detection that accounts for experimental variability. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified and demonstrated by applying several Level 1 (damage detection) and Level 2 (damage localization) VBDD techniques using experimental data measured on a steel girder taken from a railway bridge. The proposed approach is shown to perform very well at detecting, locating and monitoring the growth of damage. Copyright 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd},

abstract = {In many fields one encounters the challenge of identifying out of a pool of possible designs those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. In many applications an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the $\epsilon$-Pareto Active Learning (e-PAL) algorithm which adaptively samples the design space to predict a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that cover the true Pareto front of the design space with some granularity regulated by a parameter $\epsilon$. Key features of e-PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as draws from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accommodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on e-PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we perform an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets that demonstrate e-PAL's effectiveness; in comparison to the state-of-the-art active learning algorithm PAL, e-PAL reduces the amount of computations and the number of samples from the design space required to meet the user's desired level of accuracy. In addition, we show that e-PAL improves significantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in most cases 30$\backslash${\%} to 70$\backslash${\%} evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.},

abstract = {To deal with an increasing demand in transportation, trains are made longer and faster. Higher speeds imply higher impacts on bridges. Therefore, structures have to be designed to resist these new constraints. The Eurocode (2002) introduced additional checks for the design of high-speed railway bridges. Among them, the maximum vertical deck acceleration criterion often determines alone the design of the structure. Tests on shake table brought to the conclusion that vertical bridge deck acceleration should never exceed 3.5 m/s2 for ballasted tracks. This master thesis investigates the optimization of cross section parameters of singletrack simply supported and double-span bridges based on the limit of the maximum vertical deck acceleration criterion. The first natural frequency is considered as a proof of the feasibility of the structure. The optimization is carried out through MATLAB for both types of bridges. The deck acceleration of simply supported bridges is analytically calculated using the Train Signature (ERRI D214 1999) in MATLAB. The dynamic calculations of double-span bridges are implemented through the finite element software ABAQUS. The implemented programs have been verified by comparison to values of simple cases found in the literature. Structures are tested under the influence of the ten HSLM-A trains of the Eurocode running at speeds between 150 km/h and 350 km/h. Optimization algorithms are presented and compared in this study but their applicability in such context is questioned. Indeed, as the problem contains several suitable minima, the algorithms, which end in one solution, are not adapted. To overtake this difficulty, a scanning of the interesting zone is advised. However, the latter is very time consuming, even more if the finite element analysis is used. Suggestions to decrease analysis time are presented in this report. Single span composite bridges with a span longer than 20 m appeared to be impossible to optimize within the objectives defined in this work (i.e. considering limits of deck acceleration and first natural frequency), which draws doubts about their suitability for high-speed railways. Nevertheless, simply supported bridges made of concrete seem more adapted for high-speed railways and their optimized parameters are presented in this work. Optimized parameters for double-span concrete bridges are also presented.},

abstract = {This study performs an experimental investigation of a novel, semi-active control strategy for effective vibration mitigation. The implemented approach comprises a combination of the linear quadratic regulator with a nonlinear observer, namely, the unscented Kalman filter, for the control of systems described by uncertainties. Indeed, numerical models of structural systems often result as inadequate because of inherent uncertainties, such as noise, modeling errors, unknown system properties, or influence of varying operational and environmental conditions. In tackling this issue, the unscented Kalman filter is herein employed for adaptive joint state and parameter estimation refining the accuracy of the model employed by the controller and resulting in enhanced vibration mitigation. A scaled five-story shear frame attached to a hydraulic cylinder comprises the tested structure, where actuation is provided by means of a rotational magnetorheological damper operating on the relative motion between the ground floor and the first floor plate. The experimentally obtained results demonstrate a good agreement with simulations and encourage further implementation of the proposed framework in field applications of structural control.

abstract = {System properties of buildings and bridges may vary with time due to temperature changes, aging or extreme loadings. To identify these time-varying system properties, this study proposes a new output-only non-stationary system identification (SI) framework based on instantaneous or marginal spectra derived from the time-frequency representation, e.g., short time Fourier or wavelet transform. Spectra derived from these time-frequency representations are very popular in tracking time-varying frequencies; however, they have seldom been used to identify the time-varying damping ratio because a short window needed to capture the time-varying information amplifies the bandwidth significantly, which may lead to considerably overestimating the damping ratio. To overcome this shortcoming, this study modifies the theoretical frequency response function (FRF) to explicitly account for the windowing effect, and therefore enables SI directly using instantaneous or marginal spectra derived from the wavelet or short time Fourier transform. The response spectrum estimated using the short time window and the modified FRF are both influenced by the same time window, thus the instantaneous or time-localized marginal spectrum of response can be fitted to the modified FRF to identify frequency and damping ratio at each time instant. This spectral-based SI framework can reliably identify damping in time-varying systems under non-stationary excitations. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated by both numerical and full-scale examples, and also compared to the time-domain SI method, stochastic subspace identification (SSI), since the time-domain SI approaches and their extensions are popular in identifying time-varying systems utilizing recursive algorithms or moving windows.},

abstract = {This is the first of two companion articles addressing an integrated study on the mathematical modeling and assessment of the efficiency of surface mounted or embedded viscoelastic damping treatments, typically used to reduce structural vibration and/or noise radiation from structures, incorporating the adequate use and development of viscoelastic (arbitrary frequency dependent) damping models, along with their finite element (FE) implementation, and the experimental identification of the constitutive behavior of viscoelastic materials. This first article (Part I) is devoted to the development of mathematical descriptions of material damping to represent the linear viscoelastic constitutive behavior, their implementation into FE formulations and the use of the underlying different solution methods. To this end, internal variables models, such as the Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) and anelastic displacement fields (ADF) models, and other methods such as the direct frequency response (DFR), based on the complex modulus approach (CMA), iterative modal strain energy (IMSE) and an approach based on an iterative complex eigensolution (ICE) are described and implemented at the global FE model level. The experimental identification of viscoelastic materials properties and the aforementioned viscoelastically damped FE modeling approaches are assessed and validated in the companion article [Vasques, C.M.A. et al., Viscoelastic damping technologies–Part II: Experimental identification procedure and validation, Journal of Advanced Research in Mechanical Engineering 1(2): 96-110 (2010)]},

abstract = {Autoparametric resonance is treated as the reason of arising excessive lateral vibrations in the steel arch bridge (the Solferino Bridge). To explain this phenomenon, a physical model (a double pendulum) is proposed. Its behavior, as a rule, depends on dynamic characteristics of a bridge rather than on its type. The response of a two degree-of-freedom system with quadratic nonlinearities in the presence of two-to-one autoparametric resonance is investigated. The perturbation method of multiple time scales is used to construct first-order nonlinear differential equations and to determine steady state solutions and their stability. Bifurcation analysis is performed to determine a critical (threshold) value in the external load (control) parameter. The autoparametric resonance becomes possible if an excited torsional mode is near a primary resonance and an external load parameter caused by pedestrians is equal or higher than its critical value. When the increasing load parameter passes through the critical value (because a quantity of pedestrians on the bridge is increased), a jump phenomenon (or fast growth) is observed for the lateral mode, the torsional mode is saturated and has much smaller amplitudes. Field tests were held to understand a phenomenon of an excessive lateral movement, and to enforce the Solferino Bridge. Theoretical results of the present paper are compared with those experimental measurements. Swaying of pedestrian bridges can be treated as a two-step process. The first step (achievement of parametric resonance), described in this paper, is the condition for the beginning of the second step—the process of possible synchronization of applied forces and the interactions between them and the lateral and torsional modes of vibration.},

Large structures such as factories, gymnasia, concert halls, bridges, towers, masts and chimneys can be detrimentally affected by vibrations. These vibrations can cause either serviceability problems, severely hampering the user's comfort, or safety problems. The aim of this book is to provide structural and civil engineers working in construction and environmental engineering with practical guidelines for counteracting vibration problems. Dynamic actions are considered from the following sources of vibration: - human body motions, - rotating, oscillating and impacting machines, - wind flow, - road traffic, railway traffic and construction work. The main section of the book presents tools that aid in decision-making and in deriving simple solutions to cases of frequently occurring "normal" vibration problems. Complexer problems and more advanced solutions are also considered. In all cases these guidelines should enable the engineer to decide on appropriate solutions expeditiously. The appendices of the book contain fundamentals essential to the main chapters.},

This paper derives the suﬃcient and necessary conditions for order-1 and order-2 stability of the recently proposed multi-guided PSO (MGPSO), which was designed speciﬁcally for multi-objective optimization. The paper utilizes a recently published theorem for performing stability analysis on PSO variants, which requires minimal modeling assumptions. It is vital for PSO practitioners to know the actual criteria for particle stability of the given PSO variant being used, as it been shown that particle stability has a considerable impact on PSO's performance. This paper empirically validates its theoretical ﬁndings by comparing the derived stability criteria against those of an assumption free MGPSO algorithm. It was found that the derived criteria for order-1 and order-2 stability are an accurate predictor of the unsimpliﬁed MGPSO's particle behavior.},

Non-destructive testing by vibration methods was conducted on a selected stand segment, the structure of which recurred on the remaining stadium segments. Through experiments, we determined the vibration forms throughout the stand, taking into account the dynamic impact of fans. Numerical analyses were performed on the 3-D ﬁnite element method (FEM) stadium model to identify the dynamic jump load function. The results obtained on the basis of sensitivity tests using the ﬁnite element method allowed the tuning of the stadium structure to successfully meet the requirements of the serviceability limit state.},

abstract = {This document is a Technical Report with worked examples for a bridge structure designed following the Eurocodes. It summarizes important points of the Eurocodes for the design of concrete, steel and composite road bridges, including foundations and seismic design, utilizing a common bridge project as a basis. The geometry and materials of the example bridge as well as the main assumptions and the detailed structural calculations are presented in the first chapter of the report. Each of the subsequent chapters presents the main principles and rules of a specific Eurocode and their application on the example bridge, namely: •{\#}xF020;The key concepts of basis of design, i.e. design situations, limit states, the single source principle and the combinations of actions (EN 19990); •{\#}xF020;Permanent, wind, thermal, traffic and fatigue actions on the bridge deck and piers and their combinations (EN 1991); •{\#}xF020;Bridge deck modeling and structural analysis; •{\#}xF020;The design of the bridge deck and the piers for the ULS and the SLS, including the second order effects (EN 1992-2); •{\#}xF020;The classification of the composite cross-sections, the ULS, SLS and fatigue verifications and the detailed design for creep and shrinkage (EN 1994-2); •{\#}xF020;The settlement and resistance calculations for the pier, three design approaches for the abutment and the verification of the foundation for the seismic design situation (EN 1997); •{\#}xF020;The conceptual design for earthquake resistance considering the alternative solutions of slender or squat piers; the latter case involves seismic isolation and design for ductile behavior (EN 1998-1, EN 1998-2). The bridge worked example analyzed in this report was prepared and presented at the workshop “Bridge Design to the Eurocodes” that was held on 4-6 October 2010 in Vienna, Austria. The workshop was organized by JRC with the support of DG ENTR and in collaboration with CEN/TC250/Horizontal Group Bridges, the Austrian Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology and the Austrian Standards Institute. The document is part of the Report Series “Support to the implementation, harmonization and further development of the Eurocodes”, prepared by JRC in collaboration with DG ENTR and CEN/TC250 “Structural Eurocodes”.},

After reading and using this book, you'll get some takeaway case study examples of applications that can be found in areas like business management, big data/cloud computing, financial engineering (i.e., options trading investment alternatives), and even games. Up until very recently, Python was mostly regarded as just a web scripting language. Well, computational scientists and engineers have recently discovered the flexibility and power of Python to do more. Big data analytics and cloud computing programmers are seeing Python's immense use. Financial engineers are also now employing Python in their work. Python seems to be evolving as a language that can even rival C++, Fortran, and Pascal/Delphi for numerical and mathematical computations.},

A new approach is introduced in conjunction with the singular value decomposition technique to derive the basic formulation of minimum order realization which is an extended version of the Ho-Kalman algorithm. The basic formulation is then transformed into modal space for modal parameter identification. Two accuracy indicators are developed to quantitatively identify the system modes and noise modes. For illustration of the algorithm, examples are shown using simulation data and experimental data for a rectangular grid structure.},

abstract = {Resonance vibrations have been observed on railway bridges subjected to high speed trains. An elementary theoretical model of a bridge was investigated using the integral transformation method which provides an estimation of the amplitudes of the free vibration In addition, the analysis gives the critical speeds at which the resonance vibration may occur. They are caused by two reasons: repeated action of axle loads and high speed itself. While the ﬁrst cause of critical speeds has been reached on today's high speed lines the second one not yet. The maximum amplitudes of resonance vibration appear at the moment when the last axle leaves the bridge and, therefore, their values were calculated for the deﬂection, bending moment and acceleration of the bridge deck. Simple expressions similar to dynamic impact factor were given to these values which enable to assess the railway bridges for high speed trains. Comparison of the theory with the experiments is satisfactory. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Four different benchmark functions with asymmetric initial range settings are selected as testing functions. The experimental results illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSO.

Nevertheless, the experimental results show that the PSO is a promising optimization method and a new approach is suggested to improve PSO's performance near the optima, such as using an adaptive inertia weight.},

abstract = {Bridges are indispensable components of the infrastructure of modern society, and their assessment via techniques of structural dynamics is assuming greater importance. This assessment concerns performance of the as-built structure compared to the design and can also extend to the assessment of structural deterioration or damage. Simple validation of numerical results by dynamic testing has met some success; however, feedback from testing into analysis is usually crude, and only recently have systematic techniques been developed that can be supplied to such structures. This paper investigates the application of sensitivity-based model updating technology to the dynamic assessment of the Safti Link Bridge, a curved cable-stayed bridge in Singapore. Based on the measured modal data from prototype testing, the simulated dynamic properties obtained via ﬁniteelement analysis have been signiﬁcantly improved by modiﬁcation of uncertain structural parameters such as Young's modulus of concrete and structural geometry.},

This paper proposes a new variant of the ABC algorithm based on Von Neumann topology structure, namely Von Neumann Neighborhood Article Bee Colony (VABC). VABC significantly improves the original ABC in solving complex optimization problems. Clustering is a popular data analysis and data mining technique. The most popular technique for clustering is k-means algorithm. However, the k-means algorithm highly depends on the initial state and converges to local optimum solution. In this work, VABC algorithm is tested on a set of widely-used benchmark functions and is used for solve data clustering on several benchmark data sets. The performance of VABC algorithm is compared with ABC and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The simulation results show that the proposed VABC outperforms the other two algorithms in terms of accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed.},

abstract = {The article concerns optimization of network arch bridges. This is challenging optimization problem involving even for conventional scheme of network arch bridge the identification of some topological parameters as well as shape configurations and all sizing parameters of structural members, seeking the minimum weight. Optimal bridge scheme is sought tuning a large set of design parameters of diverse character: the type of hanger arrangement, the number of hangers, their inclination angles and placement distances, the arch shape and rise, etc. Mathematically, the optimization of the bridge scheme is a mixed-integer constrained global optimization problem solved employing stochastic evolutionary algorithm. Plane heavy/ moderate/and light-deck bridges of 18, 30, 42 and 54 m spans were optimized using proposed optimization technique. The decisive design parameters and their promising ranges were revealed. Also, the influence of some simplifications is shown: changing the arch shape from elliptical to circular, placing the hangers at equal distances, etc.},

abstract = {An optimization approach of network arch bridges using a global optimization algorithm EVOP is presented in this paper. The objective is to minimize the cost of superstructure particularly arches and hangers of network arch bridge by optimizing the geometric shape, rise to span ratio, cross section of arch, and the number, arrangement and cross sectional dimensions of hangers. Constraints for design are formulated as per AASHTO, AISC and ACI Specifications. The minimum cost design problem is characterized by having a combination of continuous, discrete, and integer sets of design variables and is subjected to highly nonlinear, implicit and discontinuous constraints. An optimization algorithm, evolutionary operation (EVOP), is used that is capable of locating directly with high probability the global minimum without requiring information on gradient or sub-gradient of the objective function. EVOP is interfaced with finite element analysis software, ANSYS for evaluation of structural response of the bridge to verify the constraints and also to evaluate objective function. Within the range of design constant parameters considered, it is observed that 38{\%} to 40{\%} of total cost can be saved for circular and parabolic arches respectively, if design is optimized. Results also show that parabolic arch with optimum design variables is more economic than the optimized arch bridges with circular arch geometry.},

abstract = {With the continuous construction of 500 m concrete-filled steel-tube (CFST) arch bridges such as the Bosideng Yangtze River Bridge and the Hejiang Changjiang Highway Bridge, the deviation between the dead pressure line and the arch axis produced by extant arch axis optimization methods increases. Therefore, an arch axis optimization method for long-span CFST arch bridges with a truss section must be designed. Following the optimization of the truss arch axis, this study develops the minimum section eccentricity method that aims to optimize the arch axis of long-span CFST arch bridges. To minimize the main tube eccentricity of the truss arch, the bending moment of the main tubes is reduced by applying the main tube eccentricity method iteratively in a finite element model. Afterward, a smooth and reasonable arch axis is fitted by applying a cubic spline interpolation function in MATLAB. The entire optimization procedure is performed using the Bosideng Yangtze River Bridge as an example. Compared with that of optimal arch axis line types (e.g., parabola and catenary) and other traditional arch axes, the bending moment of main tubes optimized by the proposed method is substantially lower and more uniformly distributed along the arch axis span. The mechanical properties of the finished bridge, including its strength, stiffness, and stability, are all improved, thereby verifying the feasibility of using the proposed method to optimize the arch axis of CFST arch bridges with a truss section.},

The model is amenable to analytical or semi-analytical treatments and is effective for parametric studies, design of control systems or structural optimizations. The Ritz's energy approach is employed to calculate the solutions of the vibration eigenvalue problem-natural frequencies and mode shapes-and the forced responses to external excitations, namely those induced by the passage of trains. A closed-form solution of the bridge dynamic response to the transit of trains with arbitrary load distributions and running speeds is found and the train-induced resonances are accordingly discussed. In particular, three European high-speed trains-the French TGV, the Italian ETR 500, and the German ICE-traversing a lower-deck steel arch bridge are considered and the ensuing responses are investigated. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The basic formulation is developed by using a finite element approach, in which refined schematization is adopted to analyze the interaction between the bridge structure and moving loads. Moreover, in order to evaluate, numerically, the influence of coupling effects between bridge deformations and moving loads, the analysis focuses attention on usually neglected nonstandard terms in the inertial forces concerning both centripetal acceleration and Coriolis acceleration. Sensitivity analyses are proposed in terms of dynamic impact factors, in which the effects produced by the external mass of the moving system on the dynamic bridge behavior are evaluated.},

An accurate representation of the moving wheel element was developed; Therefore, two elements for modeling a simple beam can obtain accurate results. In the dynamic analysis, this study advises two simple criteria to predict the train-bridge resonance effect. The first criterion is that the dominated train frequencies of nVtrain/Ltra'in similar to the first several bridge natural frequencies will produce resonance, where Vtrain is the train velocity, Ltrain is the compartment length and n is a positive integer. The second criterion is that the resonance will be produced when the train velocity is higher than 0.5Lf2, where L is the bridge length and f2 is the bridge natural frequency of the anti-symmetric shape along the bridge direction. Finite element analyses indicate that the two criteria can predict the resonance of the arch bridge and the high-speed train precisely. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The radial (in-plane) bending-vibration responses of a uniform circular arch under the action of a moving load were investigated by means of the arch (curved beam) elements. Instead of the complex explicit-form shape functions given by the existing literature, the simple implicit-form shape functions associated with the radial (normal), tangential and rotational displacements of the arch element were derived. Based on the relationships between the nodal forces and nodal displacements of an arch element the elemental stiffness matrix was obtained, and based on the equation relating the kinetic energy and nodal velocities the elemental consistent mass matrix was determined. Assembly of the elemental property matrices yields the overall stiffness and mass matrices of the complete circular arch. The analytical free vibration analysis results were used to confirm the reliability of the presented stiffness and mass matrices for the arch element. Then the dynamic responses of a typical segmental circular arch, with constant curvature, due to a concentrated load moving along the circumferential direction were discussed. In addition to the circular arch, a hybrid (curved) beam composed of a circular-arch segment and two identical straight-beam segments was also studied. All numerical results were compared with the finite element solutions based on the conventional straight-beam elements and reasonable agreement was achieved. Influence of the moving speed, centrifugal force and frictional force on the dynamic behaviors of the circular arch and the hybrid beam was investigated. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This paper describes the implementation of the natural excitation technique (NExT) combined with the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) to determine the dynamic characteristics of a T-34A Mentor acrobatic category aircraft and a modified DC-3 cargo/transport category aircraft. ??-Hight acceleration data were processed using NExT-ERA to monitor the predominant natural frequencies and associated mode shapes of the aircraft for varying flight conditions. The results show the effectiveness of this modal identification methodology and the possibility of implementing it in a real-time structural health monitoring system for aircraft.},

The methodology is exemplified using the data collected in the continuous dynamic monitoring of the San Vittore bell-tower (Arcisate, Northern Italy). The proposed damage assessment procedure aims not only at detecting the occurrence of structural anomalies, but also at localising the damage in the investigated structure. After a brief description of the tower and past diagnostic survey (including ambient vibration tests and Finite Element modelling), the results of the continuous dynamic monitoring are highlighted and the effect of temperature on automatically identified resonant frequencies is discussed. Subsequently, regression models based on Principal Component Analysis are applied in order to filter out the fluctuations caused by the environmental effects on the identified resonant frequencies. The damage detection and damage localisation issues are then addressed by using novelty analysis tools. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through the detection and localisation of realistic damage scenarios simulated with the baseline Finite Element model. Specifically, the damage localisation has been tackled by using the “cleaned” modal properties within a continuous Finite Element model updating scheme.},

However, due to a higher noise/signal ratio in operational/ambient modal analysis, being able to determine the right model order and to distinguish between structural modes and computational modes become more significant than in traditional modal analysis. The two major modal indicators, i.e. Modal Confidence Factor (MCF) and Modal Amplitude Coherence (MAmC) are extended to two-stage time domain modal identification algorithms, together with a newly developed indicator, named as Modal Participation Indicator (MPI). The application of the three indicators is illustrated on different cases of operational/ambient modal identification. Three major time domain modal identification algorithms are used the Polyreference Complex Exponential (PRCE), Extended Ibrahim Time Domain (EITD), Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA). The three identification algorithms are implemented from a unified point-of-view with the modal indicators. Numerical simulations are conducted on a two-story building structure and on an aircraft model and it is investigated how the modal indicators work to distinguish the physical modes from the computational modes.},

The main infrastructure of the survey program is the curved 15-span post-tensioned concrete viaduct considered in this paper. The viaduct consists of three continuous girders separated by expansion joints and supported on piers by means of elastomeric seismic isolators. Output-only vibration tests under traffic loads were carried out to extract the dynamic parameters of the first vibration modes of the structure. The experimental characteristics were compared with those predicted by a preliminary finite-element model. The properties of vibration modes with prevailing amplitudes along the radial and circumferential direction of the viaduct were described with poor precision. This disagreement required the calibration of the finite-element model through a tuning procedure based on modal data. In particular, the experience has shown that the dynamic behavior of the viaduct is strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of the bearing devices supporting the deck superstructures. The calibrated finite-element model can be used as a baseline model for future monitoring and condition assessment programs on this typology of infrastructures.},

abstract = {The ﬁeld non-destructive vibration test plays an important role in the area of structural health monitoring. It assists in monitoring the health status and reducing the risk caused by the poor performance of structures. As the most economic ﬁeld test among the various vibration tests, the ambient vibration test is the most popular and is widely used to assess the physical condition of a structure under operational service. Based on the ambient vibration data, modal identiﬁcation can help provide signiﬁcant previous study for model updating and damage detection during the service life of a structure. It has been proved that modal identiﬁcation works well in the investigation of the dynamic performance of diﬀerent kinds of structures. In this paper, the objective structure is a highrise multi-function oﬃce building. The whole building is composed of seven three-story structural units. Each unit comprises one complete ﬂoor and two L shaped ﬂoors to form large spaces along the vertical direction. There are 56 viscous dampers installed in the building to improve the energy dissipation capacity. Due to the special feature of the structure, ﬁeld vibration tests and further modal identiﬁcation were performed to investigate its dynamic performance. Twenty-nine setups were designed to cover all the degrees of freedom of interest. About two years later, another ﬁeld test was carried out to measure the building for 48 h to investigate the performance variance and the distribution of the modal parameters. A Fast Bayesian FFT method was employed to perform the modal identiﬁcation. This Bayesian method not only provides the most probable values of the modal parameters but also assesses the associated posterior uncertainty analytically, which is especially relevant in ﬁeld vibration tests arising due to measurement noise, sensor alignment error, modelling error, etc. A shaking table test was also implemented including cases with and without dampers, which assists in investigating the eﬀect of dampers. The modal parameters obtained from diﬀerent tests were investigated separately and then compared with each other.},

abstract = {Complexity of civil engineering structures is increasing and so is the demand of Structural Health Monitoring. Vibration Based Damage Detection is attractive solution for the detection of damage and its evaluation and for that Knowledge of the modal properties is required. In this paper dynamic response of the girder is obtained in real-time to perform operational modal analysis and Time Domain Decomposition technique is used to obtain the modal frequencies [1]. Innovative approach of plotting magnitude of modal values is used to detect the presence of damage. In addition to it, the response is processed to remove noise with the help of the filter to reduce the error. Since there is absence of clear visuals from plot of modal, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for prediction of damage [2]. Singular Value Decomposition helps in getting singular using which it becomes possible to predict presence of damage clearly.},

abstract = {The interest for robust automatic modal parameter extraction techniques has increased significantly over the last years, together with the rising demand for continuous health monitoring of critical infrastructure like bridges, buildings and wind turbine blades. In this study a novel, multi-stage clustering approach for Automated Operational Modal Analysis (AOMA) is introduced. In contrast to existing approaches, the procedure works without any user-provided thresholds, is applicable within large system order ranges, can be used with very small sensor numbers and does not place any limitations on the damping ratio or the complexity of the system under investigation. The approach works with any parametric system identification algorithm that uses the system order n as sole parameter. Here a data-driven Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) method is used. Measurements from a wind tunnel investigation with a composite cantilever equipped with Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors (FBGSs) and piezoelectric sensors are used to assess the performance of the algorithm with a highly damped structure and low signal to noise ratio conditions. The proposed method was able to identify all physical system modes in the investigated frequency range from over 1000 individual datasets using FBGSs under challenging signal to noise ratio conditions and under better signal conditions but from only two sensors.},

@article{SHEN2003,
abstract = {Modal parameter identification is used to identify those parameters of the model which describe the dynamic properties of a vibration system. Classical modal parameter extractions usually require measurements of both the input force and the resulting response in laboratory conditions. However, when large-scale operational structures are subjected to random and unmeasured forces such as wind, waves, or aerodynamics, modal parameters estimation must base itself on response-only data. Over the past years, many time-domain modal parameter identification techniques from output-only have been proposed. Among them, the natural excitation technique (NExT) has been a very powerful tool for the modal analysis of structures excited in operating environment. This issue reviews the theoretical development of natural excitation technique (NExT), which uses the cross-correlation functions of measured responses coupling with conventional time-domain parameter extraction under the assumption of white-noise random inputs. Then a frequency-domain poly reference modal identification scheme by coupling the cross-correlation technique with conventional frequency-domain poly reference modal parameter extraction is presented. It uses cross-power spectral density functions instead of frequency response functions and auto- and cross-correlation functions instead of impulse response functions to estimate modal parameters from response-only data. An experiment using an airplane model is performed to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-correlation technique coupled with frequency-domain poly reference modal identification scheme.

abstract = {This paper presents the in situ dynamic measurements and the experimental validation of the numerical model for the prediction of high-speed train-induced vibration. The Sesia viaduct is considered, which is a composite railway bridge consisted by seven spans. The responses of the bridge are measured both under ambient vibration and under the excitation of Italian ETR500Y high-speed trains. From the modal analysis of the ambient vibration data, two types of mode shapes are identiﬁed by operational modal analysis. Based on the dynamic behavior of the adjacent spans, the modes of the bridge can be distinguished as symmetrical and anti-symmetrical patterns, which indicates that although each span is statically decoupled, the ballast and the rails realize a connection between the adjacent spans of the bridge.},

@article{Drygala2019,
abstract = {In this work, an examination on the modal properties of a single-span steel-frame footbridge is presented. The footbridge is situated in Jawornik (Lesser Poland). The footbridge is symmetrical since its main structure consists of two steel frames of the same shape. The boundary conditions for both frames are the same as well. The study was completed on the basis of numerical as well as experimental investigations. For ﬁnite element (FE) analysis, a 3-D model of the single-span steel-frame footbridge was created. For the experimental study, a research scheme for in situ tests was developed. Three kinds of excitation techniques were used during the in situ tests: shock excitation, operational vibration, and slow sine sweep testing. Different functions that estimate natural frequencies, i.e., the power spectral density function (PSD) and the frequency response function (FRF), were applied. The modal assurance criterion (MAC) was used as a mathematical tool for the veriﬁcation of the mode shapes of natural vibrations obtained in experimental and numerical ways. Good compatibility was recognized between the results obtained for experimental and numerical procedures in terms of both the natural frequency and the mode of vibration. The identiﬁed and veriﬁed values of the ﬁve consecutive natural frequencies of the footbridge were smaller than 5 Hz, but they were recognized as being located outside the frequency range deﬁned as having “maximum risk of resonance”. The numerical and experimental modal analysis revealed that all modes corresponding to the natural frequencies from the 0–5 Hz range have both a symmetrical and an anti-symmetrical nature. In particular, the ﬁrst vertical mode, which can play a central role from the serviceability of the footbridge point of view has a symmetrical shape. The results of the research might be applicable to the dynamic study of the structure type considered in the analysis, i.e., for the dynamic assessment of a single-span steel-frame footbridge with a relatively large mass as well as stiffness. The investigation proved that ambient vibration modal experiments are enough for the experimental investigation of the modal properties of the structure.},
