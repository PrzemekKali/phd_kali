abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population-based algorithm motivated by intelligent collective behavior of some animals. The most important advantages of the PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The inertia weight (w) is one of PSO's parameters originally proposed by Shi and Eberhart to bring about a balance between the exploration and exploitation characteristics of PSO. Since the introduction of this parameter, there have been a number of proposals of different strategies for determining the value of inertia weight during a course of run. This paper presents the ﬁrst comprehensive review of the various inertia weight strategies reported in the related literature. These approaches are classiﬁed and discussed in three main groups: constant, time-varying and adaptive inertia weights. A new adaptive inertia weight approach is also proposed which uses the success rate of the swarm as its feedback parameter to ascertain the particles' situation in the search space. The empirical studies on ﬁfteen static test problems, a dynamic function and a real world engineering problem show that the proposed particle swarm optimization model is quite effective in adapting the value of w in the dynamic and static environments.},

abstract = {The synthesis of structural health monitoring with vibration control is cost-effective and beneﬁcial for developing smart structures. In the last decade, some synthetic algorithms have been proposed for combining system identiﬁcation and vibration control. Among them, an approach has been developed recently for the synthesis of identiﬁcation and vibration control under unknown excitation. However, these approaches are only suitable when structural measurement/observation equations contain the unknown excitations, which limits the application of this approach. In this paper, a general approach is proposed to tackle this limitation problem. A generalized extended Kalman ﬁltering with unknown input (GEKF-UI) is proposed to circumvent the limitations of previous EKF-UI approaches. The proposed GEKF-UI can simultaneously identify structural system and unknown excitation when structural measurement/observation equations contain or do not contain the unknown excitations. Moreover, data fusion of measured acceleration and displacement responses is adopted to prohibit the drifts in the identiﬁed structural state and unknown excitations. Then, the identiﬁed structural state is synthesized in real time with the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control strategy for optimal semi-active optimal control provided by magneto-rheological (MR) dampers. Some numerical examples for the synthesis of identiﬁcation and vibration control of buildings subject to unknown external forces or unknown earthquake ground motion are adopted to verify the feasibilities of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Previous experimental work has identified variations in the natural frequency and the modal damping ratio of the first vertical bending mode of vibration of a simply supported, single span steel–concrete composite bridge. It was found that the natural frequency decreased and the modal damping ratio increased with increasing amplitudes of vibration. This paper illustrates the influence of these variations on the train-bridge resonance of this particular bridge by means of a non-linear single degree of freedom system, based on the previously mentioned experimental results. As one might expect, the results indicate that the influence of the increasing damping ratio leads to a considerable decrease in the resonant amplitude whilst the decreasing natural frequency decreases the critical train speed at which resonance occurs. Further studies along this line of research may help us reduce the uncertainties in dynamic assessments of existing bridges based on dynamic measurements and improve our understanding of the dynamic properties of railway bridges in general.},

abstract = {A customized version of Fish School Search (FSS) algorithm and the innovative volitive operator of FSS (which is incorporated into the regular particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm) are applied to the ﬁnite element model (FEM) updating problem. These algorithms are tested on the updating of two real structures namely; an unsymmetrical H-shaped beam and a GARTEUR SM-AG19 structure. The results thereof are compared with results of two other metaheuristic algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on the same structures. The GA and PSO algorithms being the most popular metaheuristic algorithms used in the model updating area. It is observed that on average, the FSS and PSO algorithms produce more accurate results than the GA. In this paper we conﬁrm that the FSSb (i.e. a customised version of the FSS algorithm, with minor modiﬁcations) and the hybrid algorithm – the Volitive PSO (i.e. the volitive operator of FSS into PSO) – are also more effective in this optimization task, producing superior results when updating the underlining Finite Element Model of both structures.},

abstract = {The paper addresses and evaluates the application of system identification to a suspension bridge using ambient vibration response. To obtain dynamic characteristics of the bridge, two output-only time-domain system identification methods are employed namely, the Random Decrement Method combined with the Ibrahim Time Domain (ITD) method and the Natural Excitation Technique (NExT) combined with the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA). Accuracy and efficiency of both methods are investigated, and compared with the results from a Finite Element Model. The results of system identification demonstrate that using both methods, ambient vibration measurement can provide reliable information on dynamic characteristics of the bridge. The NExT-ERA technique, however, is more practical and efficient especially when applied to voluminous data from multi-channel measurement. The results from three days of measurements indicate the wind-velocity dependency of natural frequency and damping ratio particularly for low-order modes. The sources of these dependencies appear to be the effect of aerodynamic forces alongside the girder, and friction force from the bearing near the towers. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Lv2019,
abstract = {For multi-objective optimization problems, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm generally needs a large number of fitness evaluations to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions. However, it will become substantially time-consuming when handling computationally expensive fitness functions. In order to save the computational cost, a surrogate-assisted PSO with Pareto active learning is proposed. In real physical space (the objective functions are computationally expensive), PSO is used as an optimizer, and its optimization results are used to construct the surrogate models. In virtual space, objective functions are replaced by the cheaper surrogate models, PSO is viewed as a sampler to produce the candidate solutions. To enhance the quality of candidate solutions, a hybrid mutation sampling method based on the simulated evolution is proposed, which combines the advantage of fast convergence of PSO and implements mutation to increase diversity. Furthermore, $\epsilon$-Pareto active learning ($\epsilon$-PAL) method is employed to pre-select candidate solutions to guide PSO in the real physical space. However, little work has considered the method of determining parameter $\epsilon$. Therefore, a greedy search method is presented to determine the value of $\epsilon$ where the number of active sampling is employed as the evaluation criteria of classification cost. Experimental studies involving application on a number of benchmark test problems and parameter determination for multi-input multi-output least squares support vector machines (MLSSVM) are given, in which the results demonstrate promising performance of the proposed algorithm compared with other representative multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithms.},

abstract = {Autoparametric resonance is treated as the reason of arising excessive lateral vibrations in the steel arch bridge (the Solferino Bridge). To explain this phenomenon, a physical model (a double pendulum) is proposed. Its behavior, as a rule, depends on dynamic characteristics of a bridge rather than on its type. The response of a two degree-of-freedom system with quadratic nonlinearities in the presence of two-to-one autoparametric resonance is investigated. The perturbation method of multiple time scales is used to construct first-order nonlinear differential equations and to determine steady state solutions and their stability. Bifurcation analysis is performed to determine a critical (threshold) value in the external load (control) parameter. The autoparametric resonance becomes possible if an excited torsional mode is near a primary resonance and an external load parameter caused by pedestrians is equal or higher than its critical value. When the increasing load parameter passes through the critical value (because a quantity of pedestrians on the bridge is increased), a jump phenomenon (or fast growth) is observed for the lateral mode, the torsional mode is saturated and has much smaller amplitudes. Field tests were held to understand a phenomenon of an excessive lateral movement, and to enforce the Solferino Bridge. Theoretical results of the present paper are compared with those experimental measurements. Swaying of pedestrian bridges can be treated as a two-step process. The first step (achievement of parametric resonance), described in this paper, is the condition for the beginning of the second step—the process of possible synchronization of applied forces and the interactions between them and the lateral and torsional modes of vibration.},

In addition, a mutation operator is incorporated to improve the exploratory capabilities of the algorithm. The approach is tested with a well-know benchmark commonly adopted to validate constrainthandling approaches for evolutionary algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art constraint-handling techniques.

Waterway navigational locks are important parts of the nation's infrastructure. Locks enable the flow of billions of dollars of commerce and support efforts for flood control. Proper maintenance of the locks and early detection of damage is crucial; however, due to shrinking budgets, adequate funding to apply traditional scheduled maintenance and visual inspection is not available. Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems have been considered to assist in establishing more efficient maintenance, repair, and replacement priorities for navigational locks. This work was undertaken to develop and implement a real-time methodology that provides lock operators with a robust, accurate warning system of gap(s) at the gate-to-wall interface. This initial effort, which focused on horizontally framed miter gates and on damage that is assumed to take the form of a gap at the gate/wall interface (quoin), developed a methodology to identify the occurrence of damage in miter gate structures using data from strain and water level gages that is collected continuously from the SHM system deployed by USACE.},

Natke, Hans Nussbaumer, Anthony J. Pretlove, Johann H. Rainer, Ernst-Ulrich Saemann, Lorenz Steinbeisser. Large structures such as factories, gymnasia, concert halls, bridges, towers, masts and chimneys can be detrimentally affected by vibrations. These vibrations can cause either serviceability problems, severely hampering the user's comfort, or safety problems. The aim of this book is to provide structural and civil engineers working in construction and environmental engineering with practical guidelines for counteracting vibration problems. Dynamic actions are considered from the following sources of vibration: - human body motions, - rotating, oscillating and impacting machines, - wind flow, - road traffic, railway traffic and construction work. The main section of the book presents tools that aid in decision-making and in deriving simple solutions to cases of frequently occurring "normal" vibration problems. Complexer problems and more advanced solutions are also considered. In all cases these guidelines should enable the engineer to decide on appropriate solutions expeditiously. The appendices of the book contain fundamentals essential to the main chapters.},

Each vehicle is described by 27 degrees of freedom. The bridge is modeled by modal superposition technique. The measured track irregularities are taken as the system excitation. The whole histories of the China-Star high-speed train running through a bridge with 24 m-span PC box girders on the Qin-Shen Special Passenger Railway in China are simulated. The dynamic responses of the bridge such as dynamic deﬂections, lateral amplitudes, lateral and vertical accelerations, lateral pier amplitudes, and the vehicle responses such as derail factors, oﬄoad factors, wheel/rail forces and car–body accelerations are calculated. The proposed analysis model and the solution method are veriﬁed through the comparison between the calculated results and the in situ measured data.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study on the optimal sizing of damping braces of MDOF systems equipped with viscous dampers where, unlike well-established computer-based optimisation methods, the deformability of the elastic supports is integrated by means of a novel non-iterative design tool. Mainstream optimisation methods usually focus on sizing supplemental damping devices neglecting the damper supports' ﬂexibility and therefore their effect on the overall structural damping and frequencies of vibration. In this work, the damping braces are modelled by way of viscous-elastic assemblies using the Maxwell representation. The equations of motion are formulated in the state-space representation to facilitate the assessment of the viscous-elastic assemblies' effects. The system solution presented in form of contour plots is then used as a prime tool to select the design parameters for both dampers and supporting braces, while preserving a desired level of added damping. In addition, it is shown how this approach also gives the engineer the ﬂexibility of either ﬁxing a damper size to then determine the required supporting brace stiffness or ﬁxing the supporting brace stiffness to then determine the maximum achievable damping. A case study taken from the literature is presented to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach. {\'{O}} 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The paper is focused on the condition monitoring of a bolted lap joint subjected to progressive degradation in a tensile test. The inspection used Lamb waves propagated through the overlap area. Wave propagation signals were registered automatically by means of piezoelectric transducers. Two damage indices were deﬁned based on linear and nonlinear features of Lamb waves. The use of a network of piezoelectric transducers and the analysis of multiple signals instead of single ones was proved to effectively monitor the state of the bolted joint.

@article{Drygala2019,
abstract = {In this work, an examination on the modal properties of a single-span steel-frame footbridge is presented. The footbridge is situated in Jawornik (Lesser Poland). The footbridge is symmetrical since its main structure consists of two steel frames of the same shape. The boundary conditions for both frames are the same as well. The study was completed on the basis of numerical as well as experimental investigations. For ﬁnite element (FE) analysis, a 3-D model of the single-span steel-frame footbridge was created. For the experimental study, a research scheme for in situ tests was developed. Three kinds of excitation techniques were used during the in situ tests: shock excitation, operational vibration, and slow sine sweep testing. Different functions that estimate natural frequencies, i.e., the power spectral density function (PSD) and the frequency response function (FRF), were applied. The modal assurance criterion (MAC) was used as a mathematical tool for the veriﬁcation of the mode shapes of natural vibrations obtained in experimental and numerical ways. Good compatibility was recognized between the results obtained for experimental and numerical procedures in terms of both the natural frequency and the mode of vibration. The identiﬁed and veriﬁed values of the ﬁve consecutive natural frequencies of the footbridge were smaller than 5 Hz, but they were recognized as being located outside the frequency range deﬁned as having “maximum risk of resonance”. The numerical and experimental modal analysis revealed that all modes corresponding to the natural frequencies from the 0–5 Hz range have both a symmetrical and an anti-symmetrical nature. In particular, the ﬁrst vertical mode, which can play a central role from the serviceability of the footbridge point of view has a symmetrical shape. The results of the research might be applicable to the dynamic study of the structure type considered in the analysis, i.e., for the dynamic assessment of a single-span steel-frame footbridge with a relatively large mass as well as stiffness. The investigation proved that ambient vibration modal experiments are enough for the experimental investigation of the modal properties of the structure.},

The output quantities include: time-histories of the vertical deﬂection of the main beams at the midspan, time-histories of the longitudinal normal stress in the bottom ﬁbres of the main beams at the midspan, time-histories of the vertical acceleration of the bridge deck at the midspan, time-histories of the vertical accelerations of the suspension pivots in car-bodies, time-histories of the dynamic pressures of the wheel sets of moving rail-vehicles. The design quantities, understood as the extreme values of the output quantities, are used to verify the design conditions. The basic random factor, i.e. vertical track irregularities of the track, is taken into consideration.

abstract = {Maximum load effects in simply supported railway bridges traversed by trains are generally investigated at the mid-span section. However, this assumption is not necessarily correct. The true maximum load effect might occur at some other bridge section and its magnitude could be significantly greater. This paper quantifies the underestimation of the load effects as a result of exclusively considering the middle section, with special emphasis on resonant situations. A 2D numerical model of a vehicle–track–bridge system was used to evaluate different vehicle velocities, bridge properties and track irregularity conditions. The error due to the mid-span assumption depends on the particular case considered but can be related to the relative energy content of the higher modes of vibration. The results show that the error is greatest for accelerations, smaller for bending moments and is almost negligible for displacements.},

abstract = {The finite element (FE) model updating technology was originally developed in the aerospace and mechanical engineering disciplines to automatically update numerical models of structures to match their experimentally measured counterparts. The process of updating identifies the drawbacks in the FE modelling and the updated FE model could be used to produce more reliable results in further dynamic analysis. In the last decade, the updating technology has been introduced into civil structural engineering. It can serve as an advanced tool for getting reliable modal properties of large structures. The updating process has four key phases: initial FE modelling, modal testing, manual model tuning and automatic updating (conducted using specialist software). However, the published literature does not connect well these phases, although this is crucial when implementing the updating technology. This paper therefore aims to clarify the importance of this linking and to describe the complete model updating process as applicable in civil structural engineering. The complete process consisting the four phases is outlined and brief theory is presented as appropriate. Then, the procedure is implemented on a lively steel box girder footbridge. It was found that even a very detailed initial FE model underestimated the natural frequencies of all seven experimentally identified modes of vibration, with the maximum error being almost 30%. Manual FE model tuning by trial and error found that flexible supports in the longitudinal direction should be introduced at the girder ends to improve correlation between the measured and FE-calculated modes. This significantly reduced the maximum frequency error to only 4%. It was demonstrated that only then could the FE model be automatically updated in a meaningful way. The automatic updating was successfully conducted by updating 22 uncertain structural parameters. Finally, a physical interpretation of all parameter changes is discussed. This interpretation is often missing in the published literature. It was found that the composite slabs were less stiff than originally assumed and that the asphalt layer contributed considerably to the deck stiffness.},

abstract = {Any rational approach to define the configuration and size of viscous fluid dampers in a structure should be based on the dynamic properties of the system with the dampers. In this paper we propose an alternative representation of the complex eigenvalues of multi degree of freedom systems with dampers to calculate new equivalent natural frequencies. Analytical expressions for the dynamic properties of a two-story building model with a linear viscous damper in the first floor (i.e. with a non-proportional damping matrix) are derived. The formulas permit to obtain the equivalent damping ratios and equivalent natural frequencies for all the modes as a function of the mass, stiffness and damping coefficient for underdamped and overdamped systems. It is shown that the commonly used formula to define the equivalent natural frequency is not applicable for this type of system and for others where the damping matrix is not proportional to the mass matrix, stiffness matrix or both. Moreover, the new expressions for the equivalent natural frequencies expose a novel phenomenon; the use of viscous fluid dampers can modify the vibration frequencies of the structure. The significance of the new equivalent natural frequencies is expounded by means of a simulated free vibration test. The proposed approach may offer a new perspective to study the effect of viscous dampers on the dynamic properties of a structure.},

abstract = {There is a large number of old arch bridges in Iran's railway network which the majority of them have been built more than 70 years ago. These structures, though displaying a good performance under the eﬀect of service (gravity) loads but the seismic (lateral) loads have not been taken into account in their design; therefore, the seismic assessment of these structures is deemed necessary for obtaining their failure and seismic performance levels. So they can be strengthened or rendered out of order in case it is found necessary. There are numerous methods for evaluating the residual capacity of the structures under seismic excitation which among them the non-linear dynamic analysis or the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is the most accurate and perfect method. Selecting 22 far-ﬁeld earthquake records, the present study investigated two plain concrete arch bridges which are located in kilometers 23 and 24 of the old Tehran-Qom railway, respectively. By using the ﬁnite element method and the macro-modeling method the km-23 and km-24 bridges were simulated and totally 231 non-linear dynamic analyses have been conducted. The results obtained from the incremental dynamic analysis indicated that the seismic behavior of the bridge with longer span length is more vulnerable (km-23) than the bridge with lower span length (km-24). Generally, the seismic performance of plain concrete arch bridges has been found inappropriate, therefore to improve their performance it is necessary to retroﬁt these type of structures.},

abstract = {Passive energy devices are well known due to their performance for vibration control in buildings subjected to dynamic excitations. Tuned mass damper (TMD) is one of the oldest passive devices, and it has been very much used for vibration control in buildings around the world. However, the best parameters in terms of stiffness and damping and the best position of the TMD to be installed in the structure are an area that has been studied in recent years, seeking optimal designs of such device for attenuation of structural dynamic response. Thus, in this work, a new methodology for simultaneous optimization of parameters and positions of multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) in buildings subjected to earthquakes is proposed. It is important to highlight that the proposed optimization methodology considers uncertainties present in the structural parameters, in the dynamic load, and also in the MTMD design with the aim of obtaining a robust design; that is, a MTMD design that is not sensitive to the variations of the parameters involved in the dynamic behavior of the structure. For illustration purposes, the proposed methodology is applied in a 10-story building, confirming its effectiveness. Thus, it is believed that the proposed methodology can be used as a promising tool for MTMD design.},

abstract = {To evaluate different energy dissipation systems used to control wind-induced vibrations of a 456 m super-tall building in fluctuating wind excitations, the finite element (FE) method was employed to simulate the dynamic responses of the building. A series of wind tunnel pressure tests were conducted on a 1:450 scale model to determine the wind forces acting on the super-tall building. A FE model was also constructed and mass, damping and stiffness matrices were subsequently formulated as an evaluation model for numerical analysis. The evaluation model was further simplified to a state reduced-order system using the state order reduction method. Three different vibration control schemes, namely a tuned mass damper (TMD) system, a system containing only nonlinear viscous dampers and a hybrid control system combining TMD and viscous dampers, were examined through simulations with respect to their effectiveness in reducing the accelerations at the top of the building. Furthermore, a cost evaluation was conducted to determine the most economical structural design and vibration control scheme. The results show that the wind-induced vibrations of the analysed building can be controlled effectively by all the three examined schemes, while the hybrid control scheme and the scheme containing only viscous dampers further reduce the wind-induced vibration to satisfy a more stringent criterion for a six-star hotel. In addition, the hybrid vibration control scheme is also the most cost-effective among the examined schemes.},

In early studies, a moving-force model was used where the inertia of the vehicle was small compared with that of the bridge, whereas a moving-mass model was used where the inertia of the vehicle could not be neglected. During the last three decades, the interaction problem between moving vehicles and bridge structures has attracted much attention. The advent of high-speed digital computers has made it possible to analyse the interaction problem with more sophisticated bridge and vehicle models. This paper presents an overview of the recent research work on vibration analysis of various types of bridges under the action of moving vehicles and trains.

abstract = {Rayleigh damping is commonly used to provide a source of energy dissipation in analyses of structures responding to dynamic loads such as earthquake ground motions. In a finite element model, the Rayleigh damping matrix consists of a mass-proportional part and a stiffness-proportional part; the latter typically uses the initial linear stiffness matrix of the structure. Under certain conditions, for example, a non-linear analysis with softening non-linearity, the damping forces generated by such a matrix can become unrealistically large compared to the restoring forces, resulting in an analysis being unconservative. Potential problems are demonstrated in this paper through a series of examples. A remedy to these problems is proposed in which bounds are imposed on the damping forces.

abstract = {During the 1980s the technology of modal testing became very widely practised in all those engineering disciplines where vibration and other dynamic phenomena affect the behaviour and performance of structures and machines. The techniques involved in carrying out a modal test were developed to a high degree of sophistication while the applications to which the results of these tests could be put became more numerous and more powerful. At the same time as the advantages of modal testing were being enjoyed by an increasing audience, some of the drawbacks of inexpert use of the technology were being learned and recorded. These experiences reinforced the need for a thorough understanding of fundamentals upon which modal testing is based, and of the detailed workings of the various phases and processes which make up a successful test. In this book, all the steps involved in planning, executing, interpreting and applying the results from a modal test are described in straightforward terms. Efforts are made throughout to ensure that the reader understands the physics of the various stages as well as (if not before) the mathematics. This edition has brought the previous book up to date by including all the new and improved techniques which have emerged during the 15 years since the first edition was written. The more powerful applications are developed in more detail than previously and some new topics have been introduced, notable amongst which are the application of modal testing to rotating machinery and the use of the scanning laser vibrometer.},

abstract = {Seismic vibration due to earthquake can damage the curved bridges that are the main interconnecting component for traffic separation structures of the urban highway system. Failure of bridges during and after a seismic event is vulnerable as bridges are lifeline structures. This work investigates the application of semi-active variable stiffness damper for a seismic control of the horizontally curved bridge isolated with different passive devices. The main objectives of the study are to investigate the effectiveness of the hybrid system and to find the optimum hybrid system for the seismic control of the curved bridge with different control laws of a damper. The selected bridge is a three-span continuous concrete box girder supported on pier and rigid abutment. The bridge deck is modeled as a single spine beam and the supporting pier is modeled as linear lumped mass system. The bridge is excited with four different ground motions having different ground motion characteristics with all three-ground motion components (horizontal as well as vertical). The results of the analysis demonstrate that the use of semi-active variable stiffness damper with different isolators is very effective in controlling the response of the curved bridge. The combination of semi-active variable stiffness damper and lead rubber bearing can provide an effective way for overall seismic control of the curved bridge. The use of modified switching control law for damper is as effective as switching control law with less number of sensors.},

abstract = {Structural systems are under deterioration due to ageing, mechanical stressors, and harsh environment, among other threats. Corrosion and fatigue can cause gradual structural deterioration. Moreover, natural and man-made hazards may lead to a sudden drop in the structural performance. Inspection and maintenance actions are performed to monitor the structural safety and maintain the performance over certain thresholds. However, these actions must be effectively planned throughout the life-cycle of a system to ensure the optimum budget allocation and maximum possible service life without adverse effects on the structural system safety. Life-cycle engineering provides rational means to optimise life-cycle aspects, starting from the initial design and construction to dismantling and replacing the system at the end of its service life. This paper presents a brief overview of the recent research achievements in the field of life-cycle engineering for civil and marine structural systems and indicates future directions in this research field. Several aspects of life-cycle engineering are presented, including the performance prediction under uncertainty and optimisation of life-cycle cost and intervention activities, as well as the role of structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing techniques in supporting the life-cycle management decisions. Risk, resilience, sustainability, and their integration into the life-cycle management are also discussed.},

In this paper, different boundary conditions are categorized into two groups, namely, restricted and unrestricted, according to whether the errant particles are relocated inside the allowable solution space or not. Moreover, efforts are made to explore different hybrid unrestricted boundary conditions by introducing the favorable characteristics of the reﬂecting and damping boundary conditions into the existing invisible boundary condition. The performances of the boundary conditions are tested based on both mathematical benchmark functions and a real-world electromagnetic problem: the optimization of a 2-D 16-element array antenna. Simulation results are examined from both the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the algorithm. Comparisons show that the unrestricted boundary conditions are more efﬁcient when the global optimum is inside the boundary of the solution space, and the damping boundary condition is more robust and consistent when the global optimum is close to the boundary.},

The methodology is then adopted to analyse a number of design methods for supplemental damping systems found in the scientific literature. The analysis shows that many design methods yield a similar result of implicitly suggesting a 1st modal damping ratio of about 20%. The same methodology is also adopted to show that the contribution of higher modes is generally negligible in designing a supplemental damping system and that the required damping level can be typically obtained with a limited number of supplemental devices.},

abstract = {Due to the expanding system scale and increasing operational complexity, the cascade hydropower reservoir operation balancing beneﬁt and ﬁrm output is becoming one of the most important problems in China's hydropower system. To handle this problem, this paper presents a parallel multi-objective particle swarm optimization where the swarm with large population size is divided into several smaller subswarms to be simultaneously optimized by different worker threads. In each subtask, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization is adopted to ﬁnish the entire evolutionary process, where the leader particles, external archive set and computational parameters are all dynamically updated. Besides, a novel constraint handling strategy is used to identify the feasible search space while the domination strategy based on constraint violation is used to enhance the convergence speed of swarm. The presented method is applied to Lancang cascade hydropower system in southwest China. The results show that PMOPSO can provide satisfying scheduling results in different cases. For the variation coefﬁcient of generation in 30 independent runs, the presented method can bettered the serial algorithm with about 66.67% and 61.29% reductions in normal and dry years, respectively. Hence, this paper provides an effective tool for multi-objective operation of cascade hydropower system.},

@article{Mahmood2014,
abstract = {A modal-based global method for identiﬁcation, localization and quantiﬁcation of damage of a shear frame structure is presented in this paper. The method involves identiﬁcation of modal parameters from the vibration responses of the structure only (output only) using a combination of natural excitation technique (NExT) and eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), and determination of stiffness parameters using very few identiﬁed modes by employing a least squares solution procedure. Finally, damage is indicated by comparing the stiffnesses of the (possibly) damaged structure with that of the undamaged structure. The implementation of NExT–ERA requires a reference channel for modal identiﬁcation, but several limitations of using a single reference channel have been identiﬁed from the investigations of this study. To overcome the limitations, a new approach called multi-reference-based mode selection is proposed in this paper. The approach makes use of all the available DOFs, but one at a time, as reference channels and identiﬁes the best representative modes of the structure by a mode screening process and a mode separation process. The approach is also automated for expediency and possible real-time application. The presented damage detection methodology is implemented on the analytical phase I and experimental phase II of the IASC-ASCE SHM benchmark problem and shows an accuracy of around 90% in damage detection.

abstract = {This paper presents improvements of a multivariable autoregressive (AR) model for applications in operational modal analysis considering simultaneously the temporal response data of multi-channel measurements. The parameters are estimated by using the least squares method via the implementation of the QR factorization. A new noise ratebased factor called the Noise rate Order Factor (NOF) is introduced for use in the effective selection of model order and noise rate estimation. For the selection of structural modes, an orderwise criterion called the Order Modal Assurance Criterion (OMAC) is used, based on the correlation of mode shapes computed from two successive orders. Speciﬁcally, the algorithm is updated with respect to model order from a small value to produce a costeffective computation. Furthermore, the conﬁdence intervals of each natural frequency, damping ratio and mode shapes are also computed and evaluated with respect to model order and noise rate. This method is thus very effective for identifying the modal parameters in case of ambient vibrations dealing with modern output-only modal analysis. Simulations and discussions on a steel plate structure are presented, and the experimental results show good agreement with the ﬁnite element analysis.},

abstract = {Many applications require optimizing an unknown, noisy function that is expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task as a multiarmed bandit problem, where the payoﬀ function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-conﬁdence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

This paper analyzes the TMD design for the mitigation of pedestrian-induced vibrations with three main objectives: the introduction of a speciﬁc TMD optimization criterion for pedestrianinduced vibrations of footbridges, a critical analysis of the applicability to this speciﬁc loading scenario of classic literature optimization criteria, and a quantiﬁcation of the TMD efﬁciency in the reduction of the footbridge acceleration. A numerical optimization criterion is proposed, based on the maximization of an efﬁciency factor, deﬁned as the ratio between the uncontrolled acceleration standard deviation and the controlled one. Optimum TMD parameters are compared with classic criteria given by the literature. A possible modiﬁcation of TMD parameters that permits to keep the TMD relative displacement within prescribed limits (aspect that is often a technical requirement in the TMD design) is also discussed. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out in order to conﬁrm the validity of the standard deviation-based optimization for the reduction of the maximum dynamic response of the bridge. An application to a real footbridge is ﬁnally presented.},

abstract = {The application of active structural control technology to highway bridge structures subjected to high-impact loadings is investigated. The effects of high-impact loads on infrastructure, like heavy vehicle collisions with bridge piers, have not been studied as much as seismic load effects on structures. Due to this lack of research regarding impact loads and structural control, a focused study on the application of active control devices to infrastructure after impact events can provide valuable results and conclusions. This research applies active structural control to an idealized two-span, continuous girder, concrete highway bridge structure. The idealization of a highway bridge structure as a two degree-of-freedom structural system is used to investigate the effectiveness of control devices installed between the bridge pier and deck, the two degrees of freedom. The control devices are fixed to bracing between the bridge pier and girders and controlled by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The PID control gains are optimized by both the Ziegler-Nichols ultimate sensitivity method (USM) and a new method for this impact load application called particle swarm optimization (PSO). The controlled time-domain responses are compared to the uncontrolled responses, and the effectiveness of PID control, USM optimization, and PSO is compared for this control device configuration. The results of this investigation show PID control to be effective for minimizing both superstructure and substructure responses of highway bridges after high-impact loads. Deck response reductions of greater than 19% and 37% were seen for displacement and acceleration responses, respectively, regardless of the performance index used to analyze them. PSO was much more effective than USM optimization for tuning PID control gains.},

abstract = {Studies on vibration control of stay cables in cable-stayed bridges have been keenly interested by researchers and engineers in designing new bridges and assessing in-service bridges. Mitigation of undesired cable vibration can be achieved by attaching a damping device. A Viscous Mass Damper (VMD) is composed by the arrangement a rotational Viscous Damper (VD) and an inertial mass element in parallel, which has been used to control seismic in many buildings in Japan; however, it has not been studied to apply in field of cable vibration control. This paper proposes the application of VMD to robustness in suppressing cable vibration. Oscillation parameters of the cable-VMD system are investigated in detail using an analytical formulation of the complex eigenvalue problem and compared with Viscous Damper (VD). Asymptotic formulas to calculate the complex eigenvalue solutions and the damping ratios of the cable with VMD installed in the proximity of the cable end are proposed, discussed and compared with the exact solutions. Further, the influence of elastic support on the VMD effectiveness of a cable-VMD system is analyzed and examined. Lastly, a case study is provided to justify the proposed methodology. The results of this study show that VMD can improve the cable damping ratio more efficiently than VD where the maximum damping ratio of VMD is larger than that of VD, and the increased damping ratio is higher when the relative modes are higher. The paper also provides necessary insights into the dynamics of the cable-VMD system and a useful tool for selecting optimal parameters of VMD for stay cables.},

abstract = {The non-proportionally damped system is very common in practical engineering structures. The dynamic equations for these systems, in which the damping matrices are coupled, are very time consuming to solve. In this paper, a modal perturbation method is proposed, which only requires the ﬁrst few lower real mode shapes of a corresponding undamped system to obtain the complex mode shapes of non-proportionally damped system. In this method, an equivalent proportionally damped system is constructed by taking the real mode shapes of a corresponding undamped system and then transforming the characteristic equation of state space into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations by using the vibration modes of an equivalent proportionally damped system. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed modal perturbation method. The numerical results show that: (1) with the increase of vibration modes of the corresponding undamped system, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors monotonically converge to exact solutions; (2) the accuracy of the proposed method is signiﬁcantly higher than the ﬁrst-order perturbation method and proportional damping method. The calculation time of the proposed method is shorter than the state space method; (3) the method is particularly suitable for ﬁnding a few individual orders of frequency and mode of a system with highly non-proportional damping.},

abstract = {In order to obtain a precise dynamic structural FE model for dynamic analysis, FE model updating is usually used to correct uncertainty parameters for an initial FE model using incomplete measured data. Despite numerous studies concerning FE model updating, the computational cost is still a challenging issue for the repeated eigenvalue structures. Firstly, an improved modal assurance criterion is proposed to evaluate the similarity of mode shapes for the repeated eigenvalue structures in this paper. And then, a novel ROM-based FE model updating framework consisting of an off-line phase and an on-line phase is proposed. In the off-line phase, a reduced-order basis is constructed by extracting primary components of a snapshot matrix using a proper orthogonal decomposition technique. The snapshot matrix represents a collection of static displacement vectors of the FE model under radial nodal loads, which are determined by incomplete measured mode shapes. In the on-line phase, FE model updating is performed via a reduced-order model with much cheaper computational cost. Finally, a numerical example and an experimental example demonstrate the accuracy and efﬁciency of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the proposed ROM-based FE model updating framework is more efﬁcient and stable than the FOM-based FE model updating framework.},

From the modal analysis of the ambient vibration data, two types of mode shapes are identiﬁed by operational modal analysis. Based on the dynamic behavior of the adjacent spans, the modes of the bridge can be distinguished as symmetrical and anti-symmetrical patterns, which indicates that although each span is statically decoupled, the ballast and the rails realize a connection between the adjacent spans of the bridge.},

abstract = {The mitigation of in-plane stay oscillation in cable-stayed bridges is commonly addressed by placing an external mechanical damper, linear or nonlinear, on each stay or by introducing transverse cross-ties among cables. Although the problem of a cable with a single external damper has found signiﬁcant attention in the past and different techniques have been proposed for the solution of the free-vibration problem, limitations are related to the fact that the location of the damper is usually very close to the cable end ͑on the bridge deck side͒ due to geometric constraints, leading to inherently low modal damping in the fundamental modes. In this paper the installation of more than one damper on an individual stay is considered to overcome such limitations and to increase the overall performance of the system. An existing procedure, based on the linearized taut-string theory, was modiﬁed to allow for the presence of multiple external discrete viscous dampers. The case of two devices with arbitrary location has been solved, identifying advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution. In addition, extensions of the practical “universal curve” and the interpretation thereof are presented.},

@article{Au2014,
abstract = {Ambient vibration test has gained increasing popularity in practice as it provides an economical means for modal identification without artificial loading. Since the signal-tonoise ratio cannot be directly controlled, the uncertainty associated with the identified modal parameters is a primary concern. From a scientific point of view, it is of interest to know on what factors the uncertainty depends and what the relationship is. For planning or specification purposes, it is desirable to have an assessment of the test configuration required to achieve a specified accuracy in the modal parameters. For example, what is the minimum data duration to achieve a 30% coefficient of variation (c.o.v.) in the damping ratio? To address these questions, this work investigates the leading order behavior of the ‘posterior uncertainties' (i.e., given data) of the modal parameters in a Bayesian identification framework. In the context of well-separated modes, small damping and sufficient data, it is shown rigorously that, among other results, the posterior c.o.v. of the natural frequency and damping ratio are asymptotically equal to ð$\zeta$=2$\pi$NcBf Þ1=2 and 1=ð2$\pi$$\zeta$NcB$\zeta$Þ1=2, respectively; where $\zeta$ is the damping ratio; Nc is the data length as a multiple of the natural period; Bf and B$\zeta$ are data length factors that depend only on the bandwidth utilized for identification, for which explicit expressions have been derived. As the Bayesian approach allows full use of information contained in the data, the results are fundamental characteristics of the ambient modal identification problem. This paper develops the main theory. The companion paper investigates the implication of the results and verification with field test data.},

abstract = {Integrating sampled time signals is a common task in signal processing. In this paper we investigate the performance of two straightforward integration methods: (i) integration in the frequency domain by a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), division by jx followed by inverse DFT (IDFT) back to the time domain, and (ii) a method using a weighted overlap-add (WOLA) technique which is developed in the paper. These two methods are compared with two time domain methods: (a) the trapezoidal rule, and (b) an optimized IIR ﬁlter. It is shown that the intuitive method of a straightforward DFT/IDFT is a very good method which is recommended for data lengths exceeding 16 K samples, provided data are short enough to allow a single DFT. The IIR ﬁlter integration is shown to have very similar accuracy and can also be recommended. The WOLA integration method is shown to perform well in most cases for steady-state conditions. For cases with short transients it should, however, be avoided. A signal integrated by the WOLA method is further shown to be incoherent with the signal before integration. This suggests that the WOLA method should be avoided in cases where coherence between the signals before and after integration is important. It is also demonstrated by a simulation example that integration by the trapezoidal rule should be avoided, as it gives biased results, particularly for higher frequencies.},

abstract = {To deal with an increasing demand in transportation, trains are made longer and faster. Higher speeds imply higher impacts on bridges. Therefore, structures have to be designed to resist these new constraints. The Eurocode (2002) introduced additional checks for the design of high-speed railway bridges. Among them, the maximum vertical deck acceleration criterion often determines alone the design of the structure. Tests on shake table brought to the conclusion that vertical bridge deck acceleration should never exceed 3.5 m/s2 for ballasted tracks. This master thesis investigates the optimization of cross section parameters of singletrack simply supported and double-span bridges based on the limit of the maximum vertical deck acceleration criterion. The first natural frequency is considered as a proof of the feasibility of the structure. The optimization is carried out through MATLAB for both types of bridges. The deck acceleration of simply supported bridges is analytically calculated using the Train Signature (ERRI D214 1999) in MATLAB. The dynamic calculations of double-span bridges are implemented through the finite element software ABAQUS. The implemented programs have been verified by comparison to values of simple cases found in the literature. Structures are tested under the influence of the ten HSLM-A trains of the Eurocode running at speeds between 150 km/h and 350 km/h. Optimization algorithms are presented and compared in this study but their applicability in such context is questioned. Indeed, as the problem contains several suitable minima, the algorithms, which end in one solution, are not adapted. To overtake this difficulty, a scanning of the interesting zone is advised. However, the latter is very time consuming, even more if the finite element analysis is used. Suggestions to decrease analysis time are presented in this report. Single span composite bridges with a span longer than 20 m appeared to be impossible to optimize within the objectives defined in this work (i.e. considering limits of deck acceleration and first natural frequency), which draws doubts about their suitability for high-speed railways. Nevertheless, simply supported bridges made of concrete seem more adapted for high-speed railways and their optimized parameters are presented in this work. Optimized parameters for double-span concrete bridges are also presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents an improvement to the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) with natural excitation technique (NExT), which is called the ERA-NExT-AVG method. The method uses a coded average of row vectors in each Markov parameter for evaluating modal properties of a structure. The modification is important because, for the existing stochastic system identification methods, the state-space model, obtained from output sensor data, is usually overparameterized resulting in large systems. Solving such a problem can be computationally very intensive especially in the applications when using the computational capabilities of embedded sensor networks. As a way to improve the efficiency of the ERA-NExT method, the proposed method focuses on the number of components in a single Markov parameter, which can theoretically be minimized down to the number of structural modes. Applying the coded average column vectors as Markov parameters to the ERA, the computational cost of the algorithm is significantly reduced, whereas the accuracy of the estimates is maintained or improved. Numerical simulations are performed for a shear frame model subjected to Gaussian white noise ground excitation. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing the accuracy and computational cost of the estimated modal parameters using the proposed method, with several other stochastic modal identification methods including the ERA-observer Kalman filter identification, ERA-NExT, and autoregressive models. The performance of the method is then evaluated by applying it to ambient vibration data from the Golden Gate bridge, collected using a dense wireless sensor network, and its vertical and torsional modes are successfully and accurately identified.

abstract = {This work continues a line of research aimed at the development of a dynamically based monitoring program of bridges in the area of Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. The main infrastructure of the survey program is the curved 15-span post-tensioned concrete viaduct considered in this paper. The viaduct consists of three continuous girders separated by expansion joints and supported on piers by means of elastomeric seismic isolators. Output-only vibration tests under traffic loads were carried out to extract the dynamic parameters of the first vibration modes of the structure. The experimental characteristics were compared with those predicted by a preliminary finite-element model. The properties of vibration modes with prevailing amplitudes along the radial and circumferential direction of the viaduct were described with poor precision. This disagreement required the calibration of the finite-element model through a tuning procedure based on modal data. In particular, the experience has shown that the dynamic behavior of the viaduct is strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of the bearing devices supporting the deck superstructures. The calibrated finite-element model can be used as a baseline model for future monitoring and condition assessment programs on this typology of infrastructures.},

The method was discovered through simulation of a simplified social model; thus the social metaphor is discussed, though the algorithm stands without metaphorical support.

abstract = {In order to evaluate the usefulness of approaches based on modal parameters tracking for structural health monitoring of bridges, in September of 2007, a dynamic monitoring system was installed in a concrete arch bridge at the city of Porto, in Portugal. The implementation of algorithms to perform the continuous on-line identification of modal parameters based on structural responses to ambient excitation (automated Operational Modal Analysis) has permitted to create a very complete database with the time evolution of the bridge modal characteristics during more than 2 years. This paper describes the strategy that was followed to minimize the effects of environmental and operational factors on the bridge natural frequencies, enabling, in a subsequent stage, the identification of structural anomalies. Alternative static and dynamic regression models are tested and complemented by a Principal Components Analysis. Afterwards, the identification of damages is tried with control charts. At the end, it is demonstrated that the adopted processing methodology permits the detection of realistic damage scenarios, associated with frequency shifts around 0.2%, which were simulated with a numerical model.},

A survey in the literature reveals that few experimental studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of the NExT-ERA methodology in case of closely spaced modes specifically. In this paper we present the formulation for NExT-ERA. This formulation is then implemented in an algorithm and a code, developed in house to identify the modal parameters of different systems using their generated time history data. Some numerical models are firstly investigated to validate the code. Two different case studies involving a plate with closely spaced modes and a pulley ring with greater extent of closeness in repeated modes are presented. Both structures are excited by random impulses under the laboratory condition. The resulting time response acceleration data are then used as input in the developed code to extract modal parameters of the structures. The accuracy of the results is checked against those obtained from experimental tests.},

This paper describes the experimental and numerical studies developed shortly after construction of the bridge, characterizes the installed monitoring system and presents the results achieved with the software developed to process the data that is continuously received through the Internet. Preliminary studies included the development of an ambient vibration test and the construction of a numerical model of the bridge that was “tuned” to fit the bridge dynamic properties identified by the ambient vibration test. The routines implemented include the on-line automatic identification of the bridge's natural frequencies with the Frequency Domain Decomposition method, enabling the tracking of the bridge's first 12 natural frequencies. This unique feature is only possible due to the combination of high-quality acquisition equipment with state of the art processing algorithms.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary heuristics-based method used for continuous function optimization. PSO is stochastic yet very robust. Nevertheless, real-world optimizations require a high computational effort to converge to a good solution for the problem. In general, parallel PSO implementations provide good performance. However, this depends heavily on the parallelization strategy used as well as the number and characteristics of the exploited processors. In this paper, we propose a cooperative strategy, which consists of subdividing an optimization problem into many simpler sub-problems. Each of these focuses on a distinct subset of the problem dimensions. The optimization work for all the selected sub-problems is done in parallel. We map the work onto four different parallel high-performance multiprocessors, which are based on multi- and many-core architectures. The performance of the strategy thus implemented is evaluated for four well known benchmark functions with high-dimension and different complexity. The obtained speedups are compared to that yielded by a serial PSO implementation.},

abstract = {The advent of high-speed railways has raised many concerns regarding the behaviour of bridges. Particularly, the analysis of the free vibrations generated by each load is of great interest because they can possibly accumulate and create resonance phenomena. Regarding simply supported beams, earlier contributions showed that the free vibrations created by a single moving force are of maximum or zero amplitude (cancellation) for certain speeds. In the present paper new closed-form expressions are given for the cancellation speeds of a generic mode, as well as for the most representative points of maximum amplitude. Similar new results are provided for elastically supported beams as well. A simpler, closed-form approximate expression of the cancellation condition for an elastically supported beam is also derived from the analysis of a single passing load; this approximate formula is in good agreement with the exact results. Knowing a priori the speeds of maximum free vibrations or cancellation is of great interest for experimental tests on bridges, particularly as regards the evaluation of amplitudedependent magnitudes such as structural damping. Regarding the resonance phenomena, if the resonance speeds coincide with either a maximum free vibration or a cancellation speed, then a maximum resonance or a cancellation of resonance will occur. The most relevant cases thereof have been investigated, and new expressions which allow predicting them for a generic mode are given. Finally, a new approximate formula is proposed for estimating the maximum acceleration of simply supported bridges caused by resonances of the fundamental mode. After extensive numerical testing, the formula has proved to be a useful tool for a ﬁrst assessment of simply supported bridges according to building codes such as Eurocodes.},

After reading and using this book, you'll get some takeaway case study examples of applications that can be found in areas like business management, big data/cloud computing, financial engineering (i.e., options trading investment alternatives), and even games. Up until very recently, Python was mostly regarded as just a web scripting language. Well, computational scientists and engineers have recently discovered the flexibility and power of Python to do more. Big data analytics and cloud computing programmers are seeing Python's immense use. Financial engineers are also now employing Python in their work. Python seems to be evolving as a language that can even rival C++, Fortran, and Pascal/Delphi for numerical and mathematical computations.},

abstract = {Damping property of vertically mixed structure is hard to identify, especially in the design stage since it is strongly rely on the conﬁguration of the two component structural parts. In this paper, a decoupling approximation for dynamic response analysis of the vertically mixed structure is proposed. The optimal equivalent uniform damping ratio can be evaluated in a sense of response error minimization. It is calculated by using the superposition response spectrum method which takes the full frequency content of the ground motion into consideration rather than the harmonic excitation at a speciﬁed frequency only. The equivalent uniform damping ratios presented here are then validated by comparison with full time history analysis. Over the most part of the (R$\omega$–Rm) parametrical plane, the response error is relatively small for the each component structural parts. And then, the proposed damping ratios are tested in actual MDOF concrete/steel irregular structures. It is shown that the proposed procedure is proved to be feasible in use for practical design.},

abstract = {A large number of papers devoted to multiobjective optimization is still not well balanced by a sufficient quantity of books which can serve as a reference for the field. Therefore, the monograph by Kaisa Miettinen, a concise (as compared to the extent of the subject), formal, and clearly written text, should be warmly welcomed. It is a presentation of fundamentals and cornerstone developments of multiobjective optimization. It also reports on some of the author's own contributions to the field. \par The book is composed of nine chapters. Chapter One presents basic concepts of the theory of multiobjective optimization. Chapter Two lists the major methods available in the field. Each method is briefly described, together with some theoretical results and underlying concepts, applications, extensions. This part can effectively be used as a basis for a postgraduate course. \par Chapter Three contains a general description of some of the most popular software packages for solving multiobjective optimization problems. The description is general and does not cover implementation details. In the next chapter, Chapter Four, an important subject is treated, namely methods for graphical visualization of the search process for the final efficient solution among the universe of (efficient) solutions. Chapter Five contains some guidelines on how to select the most suitable method to solve a problem. Results of numerical testing of two selected methods, namely the Geoffrion-Dyer-Feinberg method and the Nimbus method, the latter an original method proposed by the author, are reported in Chapter Six. \par The reader can get the flavor of multiobjective optimization applications in Chapter Seven, where two practical problems, the optimal control of elastic spring and the optimal control of a continuous steel casting process, are presented and solved. Some comments (Chapter Eight) on future research directions and general remarks (Chapter Nine) conclude the work. \par This useful reference book certainly will find its way to the bookshelves of many, whose interests range from vector optimization (hard mathematics) through decision theory (behavioral sciences) to decision making in the tough world of reality.},

abstract = {Modal tests on large structures are often performed in multiple setups for practical reasons. Several sensors are kept fixed as reference sensors over all setups, while the other, so called roving sensors, are moved from one setup to another. This paper develops an optimal sensor placement strategy for multi-setup modal identification, which simultaneously optimizes the locations of the reference sensors and roving sensors. As an optimality criterion, the Information Entropy is adopted, which is a scalar measure of uncertainty in the Bayesian framework. The focus in the application goes to repetitive structures where modes typically occur in clusters, with closely spaced natural frequencies and similar wavelengths. The proposed strategy is illustrated for selecting optimal positions of uni-axial sensors for a repetitive frame structure. The influence of the number of reference sensors and two strategies for positioning roving sensors, i.e. a cluster and a uniform distribution of roving sensors, are investigated. The number of reference sensors is found to be preferably equal to or larger than the number of modes to be identified. In this case, the information content, as quantified by the Information Entropy, is not very sensitive to the roving sensor strategy. If less reference sensors are used, it is highly preferred to distribute the roving sensors uniformly over the structure instead of clustering them. The proposed strategy has been validated by an experimental modal test on a floor of an office building of KU Leuven, which has a nearly repetitive structural layout. The results show how optimally locating sensors allows extracting more information from the data. Though the focus is on applications involving repetitive structures, the proposed strategy can be applied to multi-setup modal identification of any large structure.},

Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) reveals that all the main effects analyzed are statistically significant and robustly influence tax compliance behavior. These results highlight the importance of obtaining a proper understanding of these factors for developing effective policies for increasing the level of compliance, and indicate that standard enforcement polices based on punishment alone should be supplemented by an information system that would acquaint tax payers with the compliance level of other tax payers; reinforce the concept of fairness of the tax system among tax payers; and develop programs that enhance and appeal to a taxpayer's moral conscience and reinforce social cohesion.},

abstract = {Structures are mainly subjected to various types of loading conditions such as earthquake, wind loads etc. For earthquake zone areas, the structures are designed considering seismic forces. The structure which are present in higher earthquake zone area are liable to get damaged or collapsed, hence to increase the safety of these structure few retrofitting techniques or addition of materials to stabilize the structures against the earthquake forces are done. And if the retrofitting techniques are adopted then cost plays an important role and possibly few spaces will be compromised depend upon the type of methods adopted. Later the structure may be strengthened by adding materials externally to transfer the lateral loads i.e. some protective devices have been developed. In modern seismic design, damping devices are used to reduce the seismic energy and enable the control of the structural response of the structure to that1earthquake excitation. For the present study, an 8-story structure which is symmetrical in plan is modelled and analyzed using the ETABs 2015 software. The earthquake loads are defined as per IS1893-2002 (Part 1). To analyze the structure, the static and dynamic analysis method is adopted. The response spectrum function is defined to carry out dynamic analysis. To control the seismic response and to increase the stiffness of the structure, viscous damper are provided to the structure. The structure with viscous damper is modelled and analyzed with same parameters. The mechanical properties of viscous damper used in this study are as damping coefficient Cd= 810 kN-s/m and exponent as 0.3. The results obtained and compared in the form of displacement, story drift and story shear are compared.},

For this purpose, Senyuva historical arch bridge which is built in 1696 and located in Camlihemsin, Rize, Turkey, is selected as an application. 3D FEM of the bridge is modelled using ANSYS software to obtain analytical dynamic characteristics such as natural frequencies and mode shapes. Then, operational modal analysis using ambient vibrations is performed to attain dynamic characteristics experimentally. Human walking and wind are used as natural excitation. The output-only modal parameter identification is carried out using the Peak Picking method in frequency domain and the Stochastic Subspace Identification method in time domain. After, analytically and experimentally identified dynamic characteristics compared with each other and FEM of the historical bridge is updated to minimize the differences between modal parameters by changing uncertain modelling parameters such as boundary conditions. As a result, differences between the natural frequencies are reduced from 27% to 3% and good agreement is found between analytical and experimental dynamic characteristics after FEM updating.

It summarizes important points of the Eurocodes for the design of concrete, steel and composite road bridges, including foundations and seismic design, utilizing a common bridge project as a basis. The geometry and materials of the example bridge as well as the main assumptions and the detailed structural calculations are presented in the first chapter of the report. Each of the subsequent chapters presents the main principles and rules of a specific Eurocode and their application on the example bridge, namely: •#xF020;The key concepts of basis of design, i.e. design situations, limit states, the single source principle and the combinations of actions (EN 19990); •#xF020;Permanent, wind, thermal, traffic and fatigue actions on the bridge deck and piers and their combinations (EN 1991); •#xF020;Bridge deck modeling and structural analysis; •#xF020;The design of the bridge deck and the piers for the ULS and the SLS, including the second order effects (EN 1992-2); •#xF020;The classification of the composite cross-sections, the ULS, SLS and fatigue verifications and the detailed design for creep and shrinkage (EN 1994-2); •#xF020;The settlement and resistance calculations for the pier, three design approaches for the abutment and the verification of the foundation for the seismic design situation (EN 1997); •#xF020;The conceptual design for earthquake resistance considering the alternative solutions of slender or squat piers; the latter case involves seismic isolation and design for ductile behavior (EN 1998-1, EN 1998-2).

abstract = {The success of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm as a single-objective optimizer (mainly when dealing with continuous search spaces) has motivated researchers to extend the use of this bio-inspired technique to other areas. One of them is multi-objective optimization. Despite the fact that the ﬁrst proposal of a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimizer (MOPSO) is over six years old, a considerable number of other algorithms have been proposed since then. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the various MOPSOs reported in the specialized literature. As part of this review, we include a classiﬁcation of the approaches, and we identify the main features of each proposal. In the last part of the paper, we list some of the topics within this ﬁeld that we consider as promising areas of future research.},

abstract = {The construction in Portugal of a relatively long and slender footbridge prone to vertical and lateral vibrations induced by the action of pedestrians motivated the full assessment of the corresponding dynamic behaviour with the purpose of installing a control system. The current paper describes the studies undertaken at a design stage and the results of a thorough experimental assessment of the constructed bridge properties. This experimental test allowed in particular the identification of modal parameters and the observation of the lateral ‘‘lock-in'' effect under the crossing of the footbridge by pedestrian streams prior to installation of control devices. The number of pedestrians to trigger lock-in was found to verify the formula developed within the Millennium bridge studies. Furthermore, the full characterisation of the bridge behaviour was of utmost importance in the design of a control system based on tuned mass dampers that is discussed in a companion paper.},

abstract = {The interest for robust automatic modal parameter extraction techniques has increased significantly over the last years, together with the rising demand for continuous health monitoring of critical infrastructure like bridges, buildings and wind turbine blades. In this study a novel, multi-stage clustering approach for Automated Operational Modal Analysis (AOMA) is introduced. In contrast to existing approaches, the procedure works without any user-provided thresholds, is applicable within large system order ranges, can be used with very small sensor numbers and does not place any limitations on the damping ratio or the complexity of the system under investigation. The approach works with any parametric system identification algorithm that uses the system order n as sole parameter. Here a data-driven Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) method is used. Measurements from a wind tunnel investigation with a composite cantilever equipped with Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors (FBGSs) and piezoelectric sensors are used to assess the performance of the algorithm with a highly damped structure and low signal to noise ratio conditions. The proposed method was able to identify all physical system modes in the investigated frequency range from over 1000 individual datasets using FBGSs under challenging signal to noise ratio conditions and under better signal conditions but from only two sensors.},

abstract = {Bridges are indispensable components of the infrastructure of modern society, and their assessment via techniques of structural dynamics is assuming greater importance. This assessment concerns performance of the as-built structure compared to the design and can also extend to the assessment of structural deterioration or damage. Simple validation of numerical results by dynamic testing has met some success; however, feedback from testing into analysis is usually crude, and only recently have systematic techniques been developed that can be supplied to such structures. This paper investigates the application of sensitivity-based model updating technology to the dynamic assessment of the Safti Link Bridge, a curved cable-stayed bridge in Singapore. Based on the measured modal data from prototype testing, the simulated dynamic properties obtained via ﬁniteelement analysis have been signiﬁcantly improved by modiﬁcation of uncertain structural parameters such as Young's modulus of concrete and structural geometry.},

abstract = {High cycle fatigue in jet engine blades is caused by excessive vibration. Understanding the dynamic response of the bladed disk system is important in determining vibration levels. Modal testing is a useful tool in understanding the dynamic behavior of structures. However, modal tests are not conducted on bladed disks because of the difficulties involved. One problem is that the overall dynamic behavior is sensitive to small perturbations. Another problem is that multiple inputs and high-resolution techniques are required to separate modes that are nearly repeated. Two studies of engine blade response were recently completed in which bench modal tests were successfully performed on simplified fan models. The modal test procedures for the first study were successful in extracting the modal parameters. But the tests in the second study were more demanding. Ultimately, an approach was devised that accurately extracted the modal parameters. This paper describes the challenges and the evolution of the test procedures.},

With substructuring methods, a global structure is divided into a number of independent substructures. Only the substructures are repeatedly analyzed and the re-analysis of the global structure is thereby avoided. This article reviews widely used dynamic substructuring methods for model updating and damage identification of large-scale structures. These methods can be categorized into forward and inverse substructuring approaches. The former is a conventional process that assembles the vibration properties of each substructure to obtain the vibration properties of the global structure. The latter, on the contrary, disassembles the vibration properties of the global structure into those of the substructures. In each category, both frequency and time domain methods have been developed and will be reviewed.},

abstract = {This paper aims to study crowd-induced vibration control of long-span steel footbridges with different dynamic characteristics by combining methods of site measurement and numerical simulation. Four kinds of footbridge models with sensitive vertical natural frequencies of easily generating human-bridge resonance under pedestrian loading are designed based on an actual steel footbridge. The numerical models are ﬁrstly validated by comparative investigation between the site measurement and the simulation. Detailed study on dynamic responses of the four footbridges with and without controlling systems of tuned mass damper (TMD) and multiple tuned mass damper (MTMD) is then conducted under 13 cases of crowd random excitations, rhythmic running and jumping excitations. Results show that the numerical simulation agrees well with the site measurement data. TMD system is found to be highly efﬁcient in reducing vibration responses only when the excitation frequency is basically consistent with the structural natural frequency, which obviously limits the application of TMD system in footbridges as wider excitation frequency bandwidth is caused by human activities. MTMD system are demonstrated to be with higher vibration absorption robustness appearing predominant and stable capacity of reducing structural vibrations under all the crowd random and rhythmic excitations for the four footbridges.},

BRRPs are intended to be used as stoppers, and when they are installed at the edges of girder-type bridges, they will act as stiff elastic bearings in small to moderate earthquakes (called ‘‘Level 1 earthquakes” in Japan) and as energy dissipating dampers in large earthquakes (called ‘‘Level 2 earthquakes” in Japan). The target performance of BRRPs is such that they can withstand earthquakes exceeding Level 2 earthquakes (say, 1.5 times larger than a Level 2 earthquake). The inelastic behavior of BRRPs was investigated using both cyclic loading tests and numerical analyses to acquire fundamental knowledge on their performances. It has been found that adequately designed BRRPs exhibit much better deformation and low-cycle fatigue performance than conventional BRBs.},

abstract = {The vibration of cables in a cable-supported bridge aﬀects its serviceability and safety. Therefore, cable dampers are essential for vibration control, monitoring, and the further maintenance of such bridges. In this study, the vibration control performance of an electrodynamic damper applied to a cable used in a footbridge was experimentally veriﬁed considering the major design variables of the damper. The damping performance was analyzed by varying the damping ratio according to the excitation condition and external circuit resistance. The acceleration and displacement at each measurement point and the frequency-domain response decreased. Considering the dominant response conditions of the cables in the bridge, an eﬀective additional attenuation was observed. In addition, the harvesting power considering the measurement frequency and power loss was suﬃcient to operate a wireless measuring sensor by examining the energy harvesting performance from the cable measurement data of an actual bridge in service. Finally, a stepwise operation strategy for a cable vibration monitoring system was suggested and examined by analyzing the meteorological observation data and the power output according to the wind environment. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using an electrodynamic damper to build an integrated monitoring system capable of simultaneous cable vibration reduction and energy harvesting.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is characterized by a fast convergence, which can lead the algorithms of this class to stagnate in local optima. In this paper, a variant of the standard PSO algorithm is presented, called PSO-2S, based on several initializations in different zones of the search space, using charged particles. This algorithm uses two kinds of swarms, a main one that gathers the best particles of auxiliary ones, initialized several times. The auxiliary swarms are initialized in different areas, then an electrostatic repulsion heuristic is applied in each area to increase its diversity. We analyse the performance of the proposed approach on a testbed made of unimodal and multimodal test functions with and without coordinate rotation and shift. The Lennard-Jones potential problem is also used. The proposed algorithm is compared to several other PSO algorithms on this benchmark. The obtained results show the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithm.},

The mechanical properties of the CSPD were investigated by static and quasi-static parametric analysis using ABAQUS software, and validation of the CSPD finite element models was conducted by comparing the numerical results with published experimental results. The results indicate that the CSPD has desirable mechanical properties and hysteretic performance when the geometric design parameters lie within a reasonable range. Then a selected CSPD with reasonable geometric design parameters was installed on the side piers of upper-deck type steel truss arch bridge to explore the resulting improvement in the seismic behaviour of the original arch bridge.

abstract = {The paper presents an analytical approach to the problem of vehicle-bridge dynamic interaction. Starting from early studies based on a simply supported beam interacting with a lumped mass moving at constant speed, in recent years researchers have improved the models of both the bridge and the vehicle. On this basis, the bridge is modelled here as a multi-span continuous isotropic plate; its response to external loads is defined by applying the mode superposition principle and takes into account both flexural and torsional mode shapes, the latter being usually neglected in the literature. The plate is considered proportionally damped and its modes are computed by means of the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The scheme adopted for the vehicle consists of a seven degrees-of-freedom system moving at constant speed over the isotropic rough bridge surface. The numerical investigation, based on these analytical models, refers to a three-span bridge and includes the importance of torsional mode shapes, of road surface irregularities and of vehicle speed. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Abstract Vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) comprises a promising set of techniques for damage detection and health monitoring of civil engineering structures. However, the successful application of these methods to real structures is still a challenging task, due primarily to the large size of such structures and the relatively high levels of variability in their dynamic response under operational load conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the application of VBDD techniques, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness for identifying and locating low damage levels and improving their applicability to the continuous or periodic health monitoring of structures. The basic features of the methodology include the use of a controlled and consistent excitation force, the use of operational deflection shapes (ODSs) at all measured frequency increments rather than only at natural frequencies, the use of a logarithmic scale for representing the ODS amplitudes at each frequency increment and the establishment of a threshold level for damage detection that accounts for experimental variability. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified and demonstrated by applying several Level 1 (damage detection) and Level 2 (damage localization) VBDD techniques using experimental data measured on a steel girder taken from a railway bridge. The proposed approach is shown to perform very well at detecting, locating and monitoring the growth of damage. Copyright 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract = {Navigation locks are critical infrastructure components, and their closure for maintenance and repair can have significant impacts on the global economy. The current state of inspection and monitoring of lock components is generally to close the lock and perform a visual inspection. Whereas structural health monitoring of navigation locks is gaining acceptance, automation of the structural health monitoring process is lacking. This paper reports on efforts to develop an automated damage detection system for miter gates of navigation locks. The study focuses on using strain gage measurements to identify the redistribution of load throughout lock gates in the presence of damage. To eliminate the environmental variability in the data, a new damage‐sensitive feature is introduced, termed here as “slope” and defined as the derivative of the strain with respect to the water levels in the lock chamber. The slopes form a new, stationary time series effectively purged of environmental effects. A principal component analysis, a method of analyzing multivariate, stationary time series, is then used to detect significant changes in the statistics of slopes as an indication of damage. To validate the approach, damage is simulated in a finite element model, and the resulting changes in strain from the finite element model are superimposed on the measured data. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for detecting damage in navigational lock gates.},

This first article (Part I) is devoted to the development of mathematical descriptions of material damping to represent the linear viscoelastic constitutive behavior, their implementation into FE formulations and the use of the underlying different solution methods. To this end, internal variables models, such as the Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) and anelastic displacement fields (ADF) models, and other methods such as the direct frequency response (DFR), based on the complex modulus approach (CMA), iterative modal strain energy (IMSE) and an approach based on an iterative complex eigensolution (ICE) are described and implemented at the global FE model level. The experimental identification of viscoelastic materials properties and the aforementioned viscoelastically damped FE modeling approaches are assessed and validated in the companion article [Vasques, C.M.A. et al., Viscoelastic damping technologies–Part II: Experimental identification procedure and validation, Journal of Advanced Research in Mechanical Engineering 1(2): 96-110 (2010)]},

The methodology is exemplified using the data collected in the continuous dynamic monitoring of the San Vittore bell-tower (Arcisate, Northern Italy). The proposed damage assessment procedure aims not only at detecting the occurrence of structural anomalies, but also at localising the damage in the investigated structure. After a brief description of the tower and past diagnostic survey (including ambient vibration tests and Finite Element modelling), the results of the continuous dynamic monitoring are highlighted and the effect of temperature on automatically identified resonant frequencies is discussed. Subsequently, regression models based on Principal Component Analysis are applied in order to filter out the fluctuations caused by the environmental effects on the identified resonant frequencies. The damage detection and damage localisation issues are then addressed by using novelty analysis tools. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through the detection and localisation of realistic damage scenarios simulated with the baseline Finite Element model. Specifically, the damage localisation has been tackled by using the “cleaned” modal properties within a continuous Finite Element model updating scheme.},

However, damage identiﬁcation methods of hinge joint damage are still limited. In this study, a damage identiﬁcation algorithm for simply supported hinged-slab bridges based on the modiﬁed hinge plate method (MHPM) and artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) algorithms was proposed by considering the effect of hinge damage conditions on the lateral load distribution (LLD) of structures. Firstly, MHPM was proposed and demonstrated, which is based on a traditional hinge plate method by introducing relative displacement as a damage factor to simulate hinge joint damage. The effectiveness of MHPM was veriﬁed through comparison with the ﬁnite element method (FEM). Secondly, damage identiﬁcation was treated as the inverse problem of calculating the LLD in damage conditions of simply supported slab bridges. Four ABC algorithms were chosen to solve the problem due to its simple structure, ease of implementation, and robustness. Comparisons of convergence speed and identiﬁcation accuracy with genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization were also conducted. Finally, hinged bridges composed of four and seven slabs were studied as numerical examples to account for the feasibility and correctness of the proposed method. The simulation results revealed that the proposed algorithm could identify the location and degree of damaged joints efﬁciently and precisely.},

In special cases, lower structural frequencies than those resulting from the presented frequency‐tuning criteria may be accepted. This is confirmed by experiences with practical cases: Ten case studies of footbridges, gymnasiums and sports halls, dance halls and concert halls without fixed seating, concert halls with fixed seating, and high‐diving platforms are presented. In some cases, existing buildings had to be upgraded. In other cases, where structures were still in the planning stage, significant modifications to the design were necessary.},

abstract = {Practical simulation technology is of great importance in the design and research of the maglev system. This paper presents a practical vehicle/guideway model based on an in situ vibration test and model updating method. In this model, the guideway is established by the Finite Element method and then updated by the measurement, and the vehicle is simulated as a 10-degree-of-freedom model, which consists of a car-body and eight magnets. The vehicle interacts with the guideway by the magnetic interactive forces, which are tuned by the current feedback controller. The vehicle/guideway interaction problem is solved by the proposed incremental iteration procedure. Two case studies including the Shanghai High-speed Maglev Commercial Operational Line and the High-speed Maglev Test Line at Tongji University were presented for the validation of the proposed model. Finally, the effects of random surface irregularity and distributed magnetic forces were investigated here, and the frequency response of the guideway was analyzed in detail. The results indicate that the proposed model can provide a practical response prediction and analysis because the dynamic characteristics of the guideway and the excitation frequency of the maglev train are reasonably considered in this model.},

The response histories of the train and bridge are computed simultaneously by directly integrating the equation of motion of the entire virtual structure.

@article{Guo2016,
abstract = {System properties of buildings and bridges may vary with time due to temperature changes, aging or extreme loadings. To identify these time-varying system properties, this study proposes a new output-only non-stationary system identification (SI) framework based on instantaneous or marginal spectra derived from the time-frequency representation, e.g., short time Fourier or wavelet transform. Spectra derived from these time-frequency representations are very popular in tracking time-varying frequencies; however, they have seldom been used to identify the time-varying damping ratio because a short window needed to capture the time-varying information amplifies the bandwidth significantly, which may lead to considerably overestimating the damping ratio. To overcome this shortcoming, this study modifies the theoretical frequency response function (FRF) to explicitly account for the windowing effect, and therefore enables SI directly using instantaneous or marginal spectra derived from the wavelet or short time Fourier transform. The response spectrum estimated using the short time window and the modified FRF are both influenced by the same time window, thus the instantaneous or time-localized marginal spectrum of response can be fitted to the modified FRF to identify frequency and damping ratio at each time instant. This spectral-based SI framework can reliably identify damping in time-varying systems under non-stationary excitations. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated by both numerical and full-scale examples, and also compared to the time-domain SI method, stochastic subspace identification (SSI), since the time-domain SI approaches and their extensions are popular in identifying time-varying systems utilizing recursive algorithms or moving windows.},

abstract = {A model is developed to predict bending vibrations of flood gates with fluid on both sides. The liquid flow is three-dimensional and the gate is represented as a thin plate. The fluid response is considered within the linear potential flow theory including the effect of compressibility and the generation of free surface waves. This way, the hydrodynamic fluid pressure exerted on the gate is predicted accurately in both low and high-frequency regimes. Both the structural and fluid responses are expressed in the modal domain as a superposition of modes. A semi-analytical solution of the fluid-interaction problem is obtained by describing the complete system in terms of in vacuo gate modes, which is computationally efficient compared to existing numerical methods. This allows for the accurate prediction of flood gate vibrations for a large number of simulations, making it possible to perform fatigue calculations and probabilistic evaluations. The case of a typical flat flood gate subjected to an impulsive wave impact is studied with the developed model. Results show the capability of the model to efficiently quantify flood gate vibrations considering the involved fluid-structure interaction, which can lead to more economical designs compared to common engineering practice.},

This paper discusses the strategy adopted in the design and assessment of the efficiency of this control system, pointing out particular problems with the lateral TMDs that suggest that the currently adopted design methodologies are non-conservative. The research is based on a thorough experimental investigation of the footbridge's behaviour prior to implementation of the TMDs, the results of which are presented in the companion paper, and includes a full experimental characterisation of the implemented TMDs. Results of more than one year of continuous dynamic monitoring of the bridge are presented here; they generally indicate low levels of vibration and a reduced rate of activation of the TMDs.},

Long span bridges represent the extreme end of experimental capability, with challenges for logistics and access (due to length and location), instrumentation (due to frequency range, resolution and physical separation of accelerometers) and system identification (because of the extreme low frequencies). Similar challenges apply to other extreme structures such as tall buildings, masts, offshore lighthouses and extended geotechnical structures stretching technology requirements for both instrumentation and signal interpretation. A solution for instrumentation is autonomous ‘wireless' recorders. The problem with signal interpretation is the reliability of the modal parameter estimates that is particularly challenged with low frequency modes, which ‘third generation' operational modal analysis procedures offer using Bayesian approaches. The paper describes a preliminary exercise combining both these technologies in readiness for testing two very large bridges, one in China and one in Scotland.},

This algorithm allows performing multi-objective, multi-point optimization works in a fast and robust way. It combines novel crossover and mutation operators when compared to other state-of-the-art MOEA. Recent papers show its excellent performance when tested on state-of-the-art problems. In order to test the performance of this algorithm, two test cases are presented, each having peculiar characteristics making them even harder to solve. Test cases regard the aerodynamic shape optimization of ERICA components, that is an innovative tilt-rotor concept conceived and designed recently. The first problem regards the single-objective, multi-constrained aerodynamic optimization of the ERICA tilt-rotor cockpit region. The second one is a multi-objective multi-constrained optimization of the ERICA landing gear sponsons. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this automatic optimization loop in tackling real-world engineering problems.},

abstract = {Temperature rise of an induction machine increases losses and decrease in the efﬁciency. The temperature rise depends on the machine design. It takes several hours after starting a machine to reach to thermal stability. In most of the in situ efﬁciency estimation methods, it is required to obtain the operating data of the machine at a thermally stable condition, which needs a long running time of the machine. In this paper, a method based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed, which can estimate the machine efﬁciency at different loads with thermal stability. The machine operation data at the ﬁrst 30 min after the start rather than data at a thermal stability condition are used in the method. The proposed algorithm utilizes two approaches to predict a full-load temperature at a thermally stable condition. The ﬁrst approach is based on the insulation class of the machine and uses the equivalent circuit. The second approach is based on the trend of the temperature rise in the ﬁrst 30 min of running the machine after the start. Furthermore, a method is proposed to narrow the parameters range, which helps the PSO to converge to the right answer. All results are validated by the experimental results.},

The processing of adding and declining the number of population is designed. The validity of the given algorithm is tested for a variety of benchmark problems and neural network training problems. The results of the proposed scheme are compared with the linearly decreasing inertia weight PSO (LDWPSO) and mutation PSO (MPSO), from which it is evident that the proposed scheme enhances the overall performance of PSO. {\ss} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Advances in the telecommunication and broadcasting sectors have increased the need for networking equipment of communication towers. Slender structures, such as towers, are sensitive to dynamic loads, such as vibration forces. Therefore, the stability and reliability performance of towers can be maintained effectively through the prompt detection, localization, and quantification of structural damages by obtaining the dynamic frequency response of towers. However, frequency analysis for damaged structures requires long computational procedures and is difficult to perform because of the damages in real structures, particularly in towers. Therefore, this study proposed a correlation factor that can identify the relationship between frequenciesunderhealthy and damaged conditions of ultra high performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) communication towers using particle swarm optimization. The finite element method was implemented to simulate three UHPFRC communication towers, and an experimental test was conducted to validate and verify the developed correlation factor.},

This paper derives the suﬃcient and necessary conditions for order-1 and order-2 stability of the recently proposed multi-guided PSO (MGPSO), which was designed speciﬁcally for multi-objective optimization. The paper utilizes a recently published theorem for performing stability analysis on PSO variants, which requires minimal modeling assumptions. It is vital for PSO practitioners to know the actual criteria for particle stability of the given PSO variant being used, as it been shown that particle stability has a considerable impact on PSO's performance. This paper empirically validates its theoretical ﬁndings by comparing the derived stability criteria against those of an assumption free MGPSO algorithm. It was found that the derived criteria for order-1 and order-2 stability are an accurate predictor of the unsimpliﬁed MGPSO's particle behavior.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to design an efﬁcient and fast clonal algorithm for solving various numerical and combinatorial real-world optimization problems effectively and speedily, irrespective of its complexity. The idea is to accurately read the inherent drawbacks of existing immune algorithms (IAs) and propose new techniques to resolve them. The basic features of IAs dealt in this paper are: hypermutation mechanism, clonal expansion, immune memory and several other features related to initialization and selection of candidate solution present in a population set. Dealing with the above-mentioned features we have proposed a fast clonal algorithm (FCA) incorporating a parallel mutation operator comprising of Gaussian and Cauchy mutation strategy. In addition, a new concept has been proposed for initialization, selection and clonal expansion process. The concept of existing immune memory has also been modiﬁed by using the elitist mechanism. Finally, to test the efﬁcacy of proposed algorithm in terms of search quality, computational cost, robustness and efﬁciency, quantitative analyses have been performed in this paper. In addition, empirical analyses have been executed to prove the superiority of proposed strategies. To demonstrate the applicability of proposed algorithm over real-world problems, Machineloading problem of ﬂexible manufacturing system (FMS) is worked out and matched with the results present in literature.},

abstract = {Many real-world decision problems consider more than one objective. These objectives usually con ict with each other. In the problem environments, many data and parameters are usually uncertain at the time of planning. So multiobjective optimization combined with uncertainty is a challenging research topic. To deal with the basic search process in such problems, in this paper, a new approach has been proposed that combines multiple population based algorithms under a single algorithm structure. To deal with the uncertainty, a dynamic scenario-based approach is developed and integrated with the search process, in which the number of scenarios is dynamically set during the solution process. This is a new way of solving multi-objective optimization problems under uncertainty. To judge the performance of the proposed approach, we have solved a set of standard test problems without uncertainty and a number of practical problems with uncertainty. The practical problems are the well-known dynamic economic and emission dispatch problems, with di erent combinations of energy sources. The experimental studies demonstrated that the proposed approach performs better than other well-known algorithms compared in this paper.},

abstract = {Free vibrations of a taut cable with an attached linear viscous damper are investigated in detail using an analytical formulation of the complex eigenvalue problem. This problem is of considerable practical interest in the context of stay-cable vibration suppression in bridges. An expression for the eigenvalues is derived that is independent of the damper coefﬁcient, giving the range of attainable modal damping ratios and corresponding oscillation frequencies in every mode for a given damper location without approximation. This formulation reveals the importance of damper-induced frequency shifts in characterizing the response of the system. New regimes of behavior are observed when these frequency shifts are large, as is the case in higher modes and for damper locations further from the end of the cable. For a damper located sufﬁciently near the antinode in a given mode, a regime of solutions is identiﬁed for which the damping approaches critical as the damper coefﬁcient approaches a critical value. A regime diagram is developed to indicate the type of behavior in each mode for any given damper location.},

abstract = {Structural damping in high-speed railway bridges is a key parameter that affects significantly the performance of the structure in terms of fatigue life and comfort of the passengers and hence has a significant impact on the design procedures. For these reasons its accurate assessment is a paramount task to be performed and hence the results of an experimental campaign carried out on a prestressed concrete (four box-girder) beam bridge of the new Italian high-speed network are presented in this work. A total amount of fifteen accelerometers were used to ensure redundancy of measurements. Both a time domain technique and a Frequency-Domain Decomposition (FDD) technique are used to analyse the vibration signals and extract the modal frequencies, shapes and damping ratio of the first mode of the structure. The results are compared with the design provisions, and with other expectation provided by the technical literature. The paper from one hand provides a contribution in the framework of the damping evaluation of high-speed railway bridges, and from the other hand would furnish a first assessment of those damping sources that are not usually accounted for in the modelling process.},

Such strategy enables to predict the dynamic behaviour of the composite systems given a set of frequency response functions of the main structure and a driving point frequency response function of the viscoelastic support. These frequency response functions can be obtained either experimentally or by ﬁnite element modeling. Both cases are considered in the study. After presenting the underlying theoretical aspects, the results of numerical simulations of two-dimensional structures are presented, emphasizing the procedure conceived to compute the frequency response functions of the viscoelastic mounts or joints from a detailed ﬁnite element model using commercial packages and material properties provided by manufacturers. The dependency of the viscoelastic behaviour on frequency and temperature is accounted for by using the complex modulus approach and the concepts of reduced frequency and shift factor. An investigation using experimentally acquired frequency response functions of a frame structure with a translational viscoelastic damper is presented. Based on the obtained results, the main features of the modeling methodology are highlighted.},

abstract = {This paper investigates vibration characteristics of footbridge induced by crowd random walking, and presents the application of multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMD) in suppressing crowd-induced vibration. A single foot force model for the vertical component of walking-induced force is developed, avoiding the phase angle inaccessibility of the continuous walking force. Based on the single foot force model, the crowd–footbridge random vibration model, in which pedestrians are modeled as a crowd ﬂow characterized with the average time headway, is developed to consider the worst vibration state of footbridge. In this random vibration model, an analytic formulation is developed to calculate the acceleration power spectral density in arbitrary position of footbridge with arbitrary span layout. Resonant effect is observed as the footbridge natural frequencies fall within the frequency bandwidth of crowd excitation. To suppress the excessive acceleration for human normal walking comfort, a MTMD system is used to improve the footbridge dynamic characteristics. According to the random vibration model, an optimization procedure, based on the minimization of maximum root-mean-square (rms) acceleration of footbridge, is introduced to determine the optimal design parameters of MTMD system. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed MTMD designed by random optimization procedure, is more effective than traditional MTMD design methodology in reducing dynamic response during crowd–footbridge resonance, and that the proper frequency spacing enlargement will effectively reduce the off-tuning effect of MTMD.},

@article{Pavic2002,
abstract = {Measurement of Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) on the Millennium Bridge in London was a key part in the validation of the retrofit solution for excessive sway vibration caused by walking pedestrians during the bridge opening in June 2000. The measured FRFs were employed to verify the analytical response analysis and to estimate and confirm analytical predictions of natural frequencies, modal damping ratios, mode shapes and modal masses corresponding to various configurations of prototype viscous and tuned mass dampers. These results were used to experimentally assess the effectiveness of the proposed retrofit solution. Although FRF measurement technology is fairly standard in many engineering disciplines, its application on the Millennium Bridge was quite problematic and required some unique solutions which are described in this paper. Modal testing of the Millennium Bridge clearly demonstrated that it was possible to measure good quality FRFs around a frequency as low as 0.5 Hz, which was the natural frequency of the first lateral mode of vibration. This was achieved by designing, constructing and installing a bespoke hydraulic shaker featuring a translatory moving mass of 1000 kg. As the shaker was not able to produce perfectly sinusoidal excitation for stepped-sine testing, FRFs were successfully estimated using the so-called Resolver method in conjunction with an H c estimator. The standard H 1 FRF estimator, which is used in the vast majority of modern digital spectrum analysers nowadays, was demonstrably unable to produce meaningful FRF estimates when using the Resolver approach. The FRF estimation and curve-fitting performed in situ proved to be crucial for the success of the modal testing of the Millennium Bridge. By evaluating the estimates of the experimental FRFs and the corresponding modal properties during the testing programme on site, a number of test errors were potted. This, in turn, enabled immediate repetition of measurements and/or evaluation of the structural behaviour which would have been impossible if the FRF data analysis had been performed after the testing had been completed.},

abstract = {In many fields one encounters the challenge of identifying out of a pool of possible designs those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. In many applications an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the $\epsilon$-Pareto Active Learning ($\epsilon$-PAL) algorithm which adaptively samples the design space to predict a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that cover the true Pareto front of the design space with some granularity regulated by a parameter $\epsilon$. Key features of $\epsilon$-PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as draws from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accommodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on $\epsilon$-PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we perform an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets that demonstrate $\epsilon$-PAL's effectiveness; in comparison to the state-of-the-art active learning algorithm PAL, $\epsilon$-PAL reduces the amount of computations and the number of samples from the design space required to meet the user's desired level of accuracy. In addition, we show that $\epsilon$-PAL improves significantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in most cases 30% to 70% evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.},

Common inspection techniques are time consuming and hence can have strong economic implications due to aircraft downtime. As a result, during the past decade a number of methodologies have been proposed for detecting structural damage based on variations in the structure's dynamic characteristics. This paper describes the implementation of the natural excitation technique (NExT) combined with the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) to determine the dynamic characteristics of a T-34A Mentor acrobatic category aircraft and a modified DC-3 cargo/transport category aircraft. ??-Hight acceleration data were processed using NExT-ERA to monitor the predominant natural frequencies and associated mode shapes of the aircraft for varying flight conditions. The results show the effectiveness of this modal identification methodology and the possibility of implementing it in a real-time structural health monitoring system for aircraft.},

The nature of a discrete viscous damper's effect on the fundamental frequency of a beam is revealed as the method is applied to the case of a cantilevered beam. In this process, it is shown that damping has the capacity to increase the fundamental frequency of the beam, and that there exists both a particular location and critical value of damping that maximize this frequency.},

To control and suppress these undesired vibrations secondary passive damping devices, such as the conventional tuned mass damper (TMD), were installed to the bridge. In the present investigation it is proposed to apply a more efficient and more economic type of damping device: the tuned liquid column damper (TLCD). A mechanical model of a coupled bridge/TLCD system is presented and analyzed numerically. The bridge is assumed to be a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) system. Furthermore, a small scale testing facility has been constructed in the laboratory of the TUInstitute. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions and indicate that TLCDs are effective damping devices for the control of pedestrian induced vibrations of footbridges.},

abstract = {The Land Transport Authority of Singapore has a continuing program of highway bridge upgrading for refurbishing and strengthening bridges to allow for increasing vehicle trafﬁc and increasing axle loads. One subject of this program has been a short-span bridge taking a busy main road across a coastal inlet near a major port facility. Experiment-based structural assessments of the bridge were conducted before and after upgrading works including strengthening. Each assessment exercise comprised three separate components: ͑1͒ a strain and acceleration monitoring exercise lasting approximately one month; ͑2͒ a full-scale dynamic test carried out in a single day without closing the bridge; and ͑3͒ a ﬁnite-element model updating exercise to identify structural parameters and mechanisms. This paper presents the dynamic testing and the modal analysis used to identify the vibration properties and the quantiﬁcation of the effectiveness of the upgrading through the subsequent model updating. Before and after upgrade, similar sets of vibration modes were identiﬁed, resembling those of an orthotropic plate with relatively weak transverse bending stiffness. Conversion of bearings from nominal simple supports to nominal full ﬁxity was shown via model updating to be the principal cause of natural frequency increases of up to 50%. The utility of the combined experimental and analytical process in direct identiﬁcation of structural properties has been proven, and the procedure can be applied to other structures and their capacity assessments.},

The Modal Assurance Criterion is a statistical indicator that is most sensitive to large differences and relatively insensitive to small differences in the mode shapes. This yields a good statistic indicator and a degree of consistency between mode shapes. The MAC considers only modal shapes which mean that a separate frequency comparison must be used in conjunction with the MAC values to determine the correlated mode pairs. The MAC is often to used to pair modes shapes derived from analytical models with those obtained experimentally. It is easy to apply and does not require an estimate of the system matrices. It is bounded between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating fully consistent mode shapes. It can only indicate consistency and does not indicate validity or orthogonality. A value near 0 indicates that the modes are not consistent.},

abstract = {A new series-of-types of single-span simply-supported railway composite (steel-concrete) bridges, with a symmetric platform, has been designed according to the Polish bridge standards. The designed bridges/viaducts are located on the main railways of the classiﬁcation coeﬃcient k = +2. A ballasted track structure adapted to high operating speeds has also been designed. The ultimate limit states and the limit states corresponding to the bridges undertaken are collected and discussed. The bridges have been designed in accordance with contemporary art engineering, with geometric and material optimization, avoiding overdesign. A new methodology of numerical modelling and simulation of dynamic processes in composite bridge/ballasted track structure/high speed train systems, developed in Part 2 and Part 3, has been applied and implemented in a problem-oriented computer programme. A new approach to predicting forced resonances in those systems is formulated and tested numerically. It has been proved that in the case of typical structural solutions of bridges and ballasted track structures, it is necessary to introduce certain limitations for operating speeds of trains.},

abstract = {Wind turbines are immense, flexible structures with aerodynamic forces acting on the rotating blades at harmonics of the turbine rotational frequency. These harmonics are comparable to the modal frequencies of the structure. Predicting and experimentally measuring the modal frequencies of wind turbines have been important to their successful design and operation. Performing modal tests on wind turbine structures over 100m tall is a substantial challenge, which has inspired innovative developments in modal test technology. For wind turbines, a further complication is that the modal frequencies are dependent on the turbine rotation speed. The history and development of a new technique for acquiring the modal parameters using output-only response data, called the Natural Excitation Technique (NExT), will be reviewed, showing historical tests and techniques. The initial attempts at output-only modal testing began in the late 1980s with the development of NExT in the 1990s. NExT was a predecessor to Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), developed to overcome these challenges of testing immense structures excited with natural environmental inputs. We will trace the difficulties and successes of wind turbine modal testing from 1982 to the present.},

abstract = {The characteristic exposure of railway bridges to periodic live loads makes an understanding of their dynamic behavior important to their design and construction. This, together with the fact that the behavior of a railway bridge is affected by its track system, has prompted our study of the static and dynamic properties of such bridges. The deflection and stress due to the bending moment were measured, and the location of the neutral axis of each section, the natural frequency, and the damping ratio were analyzed for three systems: girder only, ballast track, and concrete track with various stiffnesses of resilience pad of rail fastening system. Compared to the ballast track, the concrete track extended the location of the neutral axis of the structure by about 6% in the upward direction. Moreover, the dynamic responses of the structure linearly increased with the maximum load and dramatically increased with the load amplitude during resonance. However, the damping ratio was the same with and without a track system. These results confirm the importance of a track system on the essential behavior of railway bridges, especially when a concrete track system is used.},

abstract = {Resonance vibrations have been observed on railway bridges subjected to high speed trains. An elementary theoretical model of a bridge was investigated using the integral transformation method which provides an estimation of the amplitudes of the free vibration In addition, the analysis gives the critical speeds at which the resonance vibration may occur. They are caused by two reasons: repeated action of axle loads and high speed itself. While the first cause of critical speeds has been reached on today's high speed lines the second one not yet. The maximum amplitudes of resonance vibration appear at the moment when the last axle leaves the bridge and, therefore, their values were calculated for the deflection, bending moment and acceleration of the bridge deck. Simple expressions similar to dynamic impact factor were given to these values which enable to assess the railway bridges for high speed trains. Comparison of the theory with the experiments is satisfactory. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {A multi-scale and multi-object interaction phenomena can arise when a group of walking pedestrians crosses a structure capable of exhibiting dynamic response. This is because each pedestrian is an autonomous dynamic system capable of displaying intricate behaviour affected by social, psychological, biomechanical and environmental factors, including adaptations to the structural motion. Despite a wealth of mathematical models attempting to describe and simulate coupled crowd-structure system, their applicability can generally be considered uncertain. This can be assigned to a number of assumptions made in their development and the scarcity or unavailability of data suitable for their validation, in particular those associated with pedestrian-pedestrian and pedestrian-structure interaction. To alleviate this problem, data on behaviour of individual pedestrians within groups of six walkers with different spatial arrangements are gathered simultaneously with data on dynamic structural response of a footbridge, from a series of measurements utilising wireless motion monitors. Unlike in previous studies on coordination of pedestrian behaviour, the collected data can serve as a proxy for pedestrian vertical force, which is of critical importance from the point of view of structural stability. A bivariate analysis framework is proposed and applied to these data, encompassing wavelet transform, synchronisation measures based on Shannon entropy and circular statistics. A topological pedestrian map is contrived showing the strength and directionality of between-subjects interactions. It is found that the coordination in pedestrians' vertical force depends on the spatial collocation within a group, but it is generally weak. The relationship between the bridge and pedestrian behaviour is also analysed, revealing stronger propensity for pedestrians to coordinate their force with the structural motion rather than with each other.},

abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic whose performance deteriorates signiﬁcantly when utilized on optimization problems subject to noise. On these problems, particles eventually fail to distinguish good from bad solutions because their objective values are corrupted by noise. Speciﬁcally, the effect of noise causes particles to suffer from deception when they do not select their true neighborhood best solutions, from blindness when they ignore better solutions, and from disorientation when they prefer worse solutions. Resampling methods reduce the presence of these conditions by re-evaluating the solutions multiple times and better estimating their true objective values with a sample mean over the evaluations. PSO with Equal Resampling (PSO-ER) ﬁnds better solutions than the regular PSO thanks mainly to the reduction of deception and blindness, as has been found by utilizing a set of population statistics that track the presence of these conditions throughout the search process. However, the solutions of PSO-ER have been reported to be worse than those of state-of-the-art resampling-based PSO algorithms, and the underlying reasons are not known because the population statistics for such algorithms have never been computed. In this article, we study the population statistics for a new extension to PSO-ER that further reduces the presence of blindness, and for state-ofthe-art resampling-based PSO algorithms. Experiments on 20 large-scale benchmark functions subject to different levels of noise show that our new algorithm succeeds at reducing blindness and ﬁnding better solutions than PSO-ER. However, the population statistics for state-of-the-art resampling-based PSO algorithms show that their particles suffer even less from deception, blindness and disorientation, and therefore ﬁnd much better solutions.},

abstract = {Vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) for long-span bridges has become a dominant research topic in recent years. The Nam O Railway Bridge is a large-scale steel truss bridge located on the unique main rail track from the north to the south of Vietnam. An extensive vibration measurement campaign and model updating are extremely necessary to build a reliable model for health condition assessment and operational safety management of the bridge. The experimental measurements are carried out under ambient vibrations using piezoelectric sensors, and a finite element (FE) model is created in MATLAB to represent the physical behavior of the structure. By model updating, the discrepancies between the experimental and the numerical results are minimized. For the success of the model updating, the efficiency of the optimization algorithm is essential. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) are employed to update the unknown model parameters. The result shows that PSO not only provides a better accuracy between the numerical model and measurements, but also reduces the computational cost compared to GA. This study focuses on the stiffness conditions of typical joints of truss structures. According to the results, the assumption of semi-rigid joints (using rotational springs) can most accurately represent the dynamic characteristics of the truss bridge considered.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best -known position (pbest), but is also guided toward the best -known positions (gbest) in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. The particles move in the search space with considering its own velocity and position called as pbest, but pbest has the tendency to flow around the local optima. Because of this problem we compare the different Particle swarm optimization based algorithm with its principles & application in this paper. Variable Neighbourhood PSO, Adaptive PSO & Niche PSO compare to see the performance of the particles in the search space with respect to time.},

abstract = {Planar frame structures made of a viscoelastic material are considered in the paper. The technically very important structures made of a homogenous material are contemplated. A family of rheological models (classic and fractional) are used to describe the mechanical properties of the viscoelastic material. In particular, the dynamic characteristics of the structures are of interest. A numerically very efﬁcient method is proposed to determine such characteristics. The method requires the solution to the linear eigenvalue problem for corresponding elastic structures and the solution to a nonlinear, algebraic equation. The presented method is much more efﬁcient than other methods where, very often, the continuation method is used to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The inﬂuence of temperature changes on dynamic characteristics is analyzed using the frequency–temperature principle. The results of several parametric analyses are presented and discussed. For the ﬁrst time, the inﬂuence of temperature on the dynamic characteristics of beams has been studied in detail.},

A possible solution to reduce inadmissible levels of deck vertical acceleration, based on retrofitting the bridge with fluid viscous dampers connected to the slab and to an auxiliary structure, is proposed and evaluated. To this end, two real bridges belonging to the Spanish railway network are analysed using an orthotropic plate Finite Element model, which properties are updated from experimental tests performed on the structures in the past. A possible conditioning of the respective lines for higher design velocities than the current ones is considered, leading to inadmissible performances of the bridges. A particular retrofit is proposed for each structure in order to accomplish the Serviceability Limit State of vertical acceleration, and the controlling effect of the proposed system is shown for a wide range of trains and circulating velocities. In order to realistically assess the technical feasibility of the alternative, special attention is given to practical aspects related to the auxiliary structure and dampers installation.},

Depending on the values of the variables, a design of the support and ordinary stiffeners and their location along the length of the beam is performed. When varying the thickness of the sheets, the change in the design resistance is taken into account. As a mathematical model for calculating the stress-strain state, analytical expressions are used. To save the best solutions, the method of copying particles and their storage strategy in the database are used. This database is generated in accordance with the elitist principle, known in the evolutionary modeling theory. This makes it possible to obtain a high-performance optimization algorithm for structures of this type. The verification of the solution is performed using the finite element analysis.},

abstract = {Fatigue damage of suspenders is a main concern during the life-cycle maintenance of arch bridges and suspension bridges. This paper presents a practical framework for estimating the fatigue life of suspenders under repeated traﬃc loads by taking a three-pylon suspension bridge as an example. First, the basic theory of vehicle–bridge interaction (VBI) is introduced and a ﬁnite element model of the bridge structure is established. Second, the fatigue load spectrum is deﬁned in detail based on the analysis of WIM (weigh-in-motion) data. And then, parametric analysis is carried out to clarify the inﬂuence of road roughness, vehicle speed, and driving lanes. Among which, the time-dependent stress laws are simulated according to the deﬁned fatigue load spectrum and the stress range is counted through the Rain ﬂow counting method. At last, the fatigue life of uncorroded suspenders and naturally corroded suspenders is estimated by an S–N curve and Miner cumulative damage criterion. Results reveal that the fatigue life of suspenders is more than 100 years if no corrosion happens, while less than 20 years for short suspenders considering the inﬂuence of natural corrosion.},

abstract = {Although building structures can be designed to meet the life safety criterion and to deform inelastically without inducing collapse under major earthquakes, the structural and nonstructural damage associated with inelastic responses is normally very costly to repair. In this paper, friction dampers are utilized to upgrade the seismic performance of timber-steel hybrid structure, which has been proposed as an alternative structural solution for multi-story buildings. The hybrid structural system consists of steel moment resisting frame and inﬁll light wood frame shear wall, both of which serve as the main lateral load resisting components, and friction dampers are introduced as frame-to-wall connectors to mitigate earthquake-induced damage. Pseudo-static loading tests were carried out on three timber-steel hybrid lateral load resisting subassemblies, and test results showed that the friction dampers were very effective in dissipating earthquake input energy, and correspondingly, much less damage was observed within the main structural members. The software package OpenSees was used to simulate the hysteretic behavior of the hybrid structure, and the developed ﬁnite element model was further validated by test results. Moreover, an optimal damper design solution was provided for a four-story timber-steel hybrid prototype building according to the numerical results from massive time-history analyses. Finally, the ﬂoor acceleration and inter-story drift responses of the prototype building with optimal damper conﬁgurations were assessed. This research aims to contribute to the development of novel timber hybrid structural systems with enhanced seismic performance.},

abstract = {There are many problems exist in the Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) using Genetic Algorithm (GA), such as slow convergence speed, being easy to fall into the partial optimum ,etc. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) can accelerate the space searching and reduce the number of convergences and iterations. The proposed characteristics of Genetic Algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (GAPSO) are proved by many examples, when the GA, PSO and GAPSO are adopted under the same conditions, GAPSO can get the least iteration numbers and the highest evolvable success rate. It also can reduce the number of convergence iteration and raise the accuracy of searching. And the performance of PSO is inferior to the performance of GAPSO, while the GA has the worst searching performance. It also can be found that the number of initializing particles will affect the number of convergences and iterations. The larger the number of the initializing particles is, the less the number of iterations will be.},

@article{Gattulli2013,
abstract = {A simple dynamic system composed of two linear oscillators is employed to analyze the passive control performance that can be achieved through a visco-elastic damper connecting two adjacent free-standing structures. By extension, the model may also describe the energy dissipation which can be obtained by an internal coupling between two quasi-independent sub-systems composing a single complex structure. Two alternatives are evaluated for the linear coupling by considering either the serial or the parallel spring–dashpot arrangement known as the Kelvin–Voigt and the Maxwell damper model, which may synthetically reproduce the constitutive behavior of different industrial devices. The complex eigenvalues of the coupled system are parametrically analyzed to determine the potential benefits realized by different combinations of the coupling stiffness and damping coefficient. A design strategy to assess these parameters is outlined, driven by the relevant observation that a perfect tuning of the natural frequencies always corresponds, in the parameter space, to the maximum modal damping for one of the resonant modes, independent of the damper model. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is discussed for different classes of the controlled system, depending on the mass and stiffness ratio of the component oscillators. As a major result, different design parameter charts for the two damper models are carried out and compared to each other. Performance indexes are introduced to quantitatively evaluate the passive control performance with respect to the mitigation of the system forced response under harmonic and seismic ground excitation. The analyses confirm the validity of the design strategy for a well-balanced mitigation of the displacement and acceleration response in both the oscillators.},

abstract = {This article presents a new particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based multi-objective optimization algorithm, named multi-guide particle swarm optimization (MGPSO). The MGPSO is a multi-swarm approach, where each subswarm optimizes one of the objectives. An archive guide is added to the velocity update equation to facilitate convergence to a Pareto front of non-dominated solutions. An extensive empirical and stability analysis of the MGPSO is conducted. The empirical analysis focuses on the exploration behavior of the MGPSO and compares the performance of the MGPSO with that of state-of-the-art multi-objective PSO and evolutionary algorithms. The results show that the MGPSO is highly competitive on a number of benchmark functions. The paper provides a theoretical stability analysis which focuses on the sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for order-1 and order-2 stability of the MGPSO. The paper extends existing work on MGPSO stability analysis by deriving new stability criteria for differing values of the acceleration coefﬁcients used in the velocity update equation.},

The aim is to determine useful and propaedeutical results in order to study the effects of combined loads transmitted both by a single axle (constant component + harmonic components) and by multiple axle subsystems equally spaced. In particular, we reconsider the case of constant load, refining the results available in the literature, and propose some new aspects that are essential for the final analysis. We analyze the concept of critical speed and we argue that in the present context it does not have great significance. We also consider how the phase and frequency of the harmonic load affects the calculation of the deflection of the bridge. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Resonance vibrations have been observed on railway bridges subjected to high speed trains. An elementary theoretical model of a bridge was investigated using the integral transformation method which provides an estimation of the amplitudes of the free vibration In addition, the analysis gives the critical speeds at which the resonance vibration may occur. They are caused by two reasons: repeated action of axle loads and high speed itself. While the ﬁrst cause of critical speeds has been reached on today's high speed lines the second one not yet. The maximum amplitudes of resonance vibration appear at the moment when the last axle leaves the bridge and, therefore, their values were calculated for the deﬂection, bending moment and acceleration of the bridge deck. Simple expressions similar to dynamic impact factor were given to these values which enable to assess the railway bridges for high speed trains. Comparison of the theory with the experiments is satisfactory. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For footbridge production environmentally friendly PET foam core may be used.

The proposed STMD has attractive features. Firstly, its effectiveness under harmonic excitation is equivalent – also in the case of frequency detuning – to the TMD with K-times larger mass, where K, ranging from 2 to 7, is the main design parameter of the STMD. Secondly, its maximal displacement is not greater than for the TMD having the same mass. Finally, its structure is almost as simple as that of the TMD and it is formed by replacing a viscous damper in the TMD with a controllable damper, for example a magnetorheological damper. The paper presents the tuning of the feedback gains that are introduced along with their correction factors aiming at minimisation of the adverse effect of clipping the active forces. Finding the optimal correction factors together with their polynomial approximations are reported. Due to the practical importance of the proposed STMD, its complete numerical validation as well as in-depth characterisation are provided.},

According to the train load frequency analysis, resonant effects will occur as the modal frequencies of a bridge are close to the multiple of the impact frequency of the train load to the bridge. An MTMD system is then designed to alter the bridge dynamic characteristics to avoid excessive vibrations. Numerical results from simply supported bridges of the Taiwan High-Speed Railway ͑THSR͒ under real trains show that the proposed MTMD is more effective and reliable than a single TMD in reducing dynamic responses during resonant speeds, as the train axle arrangement is regular. It is also found that the inner space of a bridge box-girder of the THSR is wide and deep enough for installation and movement of MTMDs.},

Owing to the NP-hardness of the problem, this paper introduces a Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) algorithm, a Memetic Algorithm (MA), a Weighted sum Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGAW), and a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve a just-in-time sequencing problem where these objectives are to be optimized simultaneously. The performance of these algorithms is compared against each other on small, medium, and large problems. According to statistical analysis, experimental results show that discrete particle swarm optimization outperforms the other algorithms in respect of a comparison metric.},

abstract = {The dynamic vibration absorber, which is adopted to suppress the unbalanced vibration of rotor, is optimized for the optimal parameters in this paper. This paper proposes a parameter optimization method for dynamic vibration absorbers and seeks parameters of a dynamic vibration absorber with better vibration suppression performance. Firstly, the frequency response function of the dynamic vibration absorber-rotor coupling system is obtained by using the finite element method. Then, basing on the optimal mathematical model, the optimal design variables are solved with the adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm. Also, an example is used to prove the validity of the optimization design method mentioned in this paper. Further, in order to master the influence of deviation from the optimal value on the suppressing vibration effect, the vibration suppression performance changes of the dynamic vibration absorber whose parameters deviate from the optimal value are analyzed. The results show that: compared with conventional design method, this method is more superior; The dynamic vibration absorber with optimal parameters has better vibration suppression performance; At the same degree deviated from the optimal value, the stiffness has a more remarkable influence on the vibration suppression performance than damping for suppressing the first resonance; For the dynamic vibration absorber which is adopted to suppress the fixed-frequency vibration, the influence of stiffness deviation on the vibration suppression performance appears an obvious interval which is related to working speed.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization is a popular nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm and has been used extensively to solve single- and multi-objective optimization problems over the last two decades. Several local and global search strategies, and learning and parameter adaptation strategies have been included in particle swarm optimization to improve its performance over the years. Most of these approaches are observed to increase the number of user-deﬁned parameters and algorithmic steps resulting in an increased complexity of the algorithm. This paper presents a simpliﬁed multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm in which the exploitation (guided) and exploration (random) moves are simpliﬁed using a detailed qualitative analysis of similar existing operators present in the real-coded elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The developed algorithm is then tested quantitatively on 30 well-known benchmark problems and compared with a real-coded elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, and its variant with a simulated binary jumping gene operator and multi-objective non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization algorithm. In the comparison, the developed algorithm is found to be superior in terms of convergence speed. It is also found to be better with respect to four recent multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms and four differential evolution variants in an extended comparative analysis. Finally, it is applied to a newly formulated industrial multi-objective optimization problem of a residue (bottom product from the crude distillation unit) ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit where it shows a better performance than the other compared algorithms.},

In the case of the railway vehicle, the methodology uses the impulse excitations of a single car by means of the wedge method. In the case of the bridge spans, free responses are collected after the passages of trains. The global modal parameters (frequencies and modal damping) of both structures are identified using two modal identification techniques, i.e., the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) and the peak picking method (PP). A simplified single-suspension model of the vehicle with 11 global dof's is proposed that can be useful in the bridge-vehicle interaction analysis. Two steel spans having non-ballasted tracks are the bridge structures. Field tests are conducted to identify the modal parameters and validate the numerical models. Finally, numerical simulations of the train passing over the bridges are compared with the in situ measurements performed under operating conditions.},

abstract = {Distributed energy systems are considered as a promising technology for sustainable development and have become a popular research topic in the areas of building energy systems. This work presents a case study of optimizing an integrated distributed energy system consisting of combined heat and power (CHP), photovoltaics (PV), and electric and/or thermal energy storage for a hospital and large hotel buildings located in Texas and California. First, simulation models for all subsystems, which are developed individually, are integrated together according to a control strategy designed to satisfy both the electric and thermal energy requirements of a building. Subsequently, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is employed to obtain an optimal design of each subsystem. The objectives of the optimization are to minimize the simple payback period (PBP) and maximize the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (RCDE). Finally, the energy performance for the selected building types and locations are analyzed after the optimization. Results indicate that the proposed optimization method could be applied to determine an optimal design of distributed energy systems, which reaches a trade-off between the economic and environmental performance for different buildings. With the presented distributed energy system, a peak shaving in electricity of about 300 kW and a reduction in boiler fuel consumption of 610 kW could be attained for the hospital building located in California for a winter day. For the summer and transition seasons, electricity peak shaving of 800 kW and 600 kW could be achieved, respectively.},

abstract = {Stay cables are one of the most critical structural components in modern cable-stayed bridges and the cable tension plays an important role in the construction, control and monitoring of cable-stayed bridges. We propose a time domain and a time–frequency domain approaches for modal parameter identiﬁcation of stay cables using output-only measurements. The time domain approach uses the subspace algorithm which is improved with a new modal coherence indicator. The time–frequency approach uses the wavelet transform of signals which is improved with a new analyzing wavelet. The wavelet transform is applied to the free response of ambient vibration which is obtained using the random decrement technique. Two experiments of stay cables are presented. The ﬁrst experiment concerns a stay cable in laboratory where the external load is applied through an impact hammer and the vibratory signals are acquired through four accelerometers. The second experiment concerns the Jinma cable-stayed bridge that connects Guangzhou and Zhaoqing in China. It is a single tower, double row cablestayed bridge supported by 112 stay cables. Ambient vibration of each stay cable is carried out using accelerometers. From output-only measurements, the modal parameters of stay cables are extracted. Once the eigenfrequencies and the damping coefﬁcients are obtained, the cable forces and the Scruton number are derived. In a continuous monitoring and modal analysis process, the tension forces and Scruton numbers could be used to assess the health of stay cables in cable-stayed bridges.},

abstract = {A novel Cooperative Bee Swarm Optimization (CBSO) algorithm based on foraging behaviour of honey bees is presented. The CBSO employs cooperative behaviours of multiple swarms in optimizing numerical functions. The proposed approach provides different patterns which are used by the bees to adjust their flying trajectories. The flying patterns provide an efficient way to balance exploration and exploitation. Cooperation is obtained by sharing information between swarms through a leader swarm. Also, a colonization process is performed between swarms. In colonization process a portion of an extinct swarm is replaced with the individuals from a colonist swarm. The proposed algorithm was tested on a set of well-known test functions. Results have shown that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and outperforms other genetic, particle swarm, and bee algorithms examined in this paper.},

abstract = {Three analysis methods are compared for determining the equivalent viscous damping ratios in a simple one-story, one-bay system with three different added damping conﬁgurations. The analysis methods are modal strain energy using the undamped mode shapes, free vibration log decrement, and complex eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis. The damping conﬁgurations include a diagonal conﬁguration, a horizontal conﬁguration, and a toggle-braced system. For each of these systems, a variety of linkage stiffness and damper capacities are considered. In all cases the structure, exclusive of the dampers, is assumed to remain elastic. A brief discussion is provided for the behavior of systems with nonlinear viscous dampers. The results of the study show that signiﬁcantly different values may be obtained for the effective viscous damping in the same system when different analysis approaches are used. For the toggle-braced system with relatively ﬂexible linkages, it was shown that the modal strain energy approach consistently produced increasing effective damping with increased damper capacity, while the other two methods indicated the opposite results. Subsequent analysis of the toggle-braced structure using the complex eigenvalue-eigenvector approach showed that the effective system damping was indeed decreasing with an increased device damping constant, and that the behavior could be attributed to the axial ﬂexibility of the toggle brace linkage. The analysis indicated that the greater the ﬂexibility of the linkage relative to the damping constant of the device, the greater the phase difference between the deformational velocity in the device and the relative horizontal velocity of the story containing the device. While the phase shift is evident from response history analysis, the most efﬁcient visualization tool is a plot of the damped mode shapes on a complex plane.},

The algorithm is used to estimate the location and severity of a crack by minimizing the differences between measured and calculated frequencies. The method is veriﬁed using experimentally measured data on a cantilever steel beam. The Fourier transform is adopted to improve the frequency resolution.

abstract = {In Japan, the seismic behavior of the bridge structures is a much under-researched area of the civil engineering field since bridges have enormous importance and number for providing connection between the scattered islands. In this sense seismic design and analysis methods are paid much attention to get optimum behavior under severe earthquakes during bridge service life. In this paper, the retrofitting process of an existed upper-deck type steel arch bridge located in the Ground Type I which include good diluvial ground and rock is investigated. Since the bridge has been designed by the old code of 1980, it is in need of retrofitting. As a first step of dynamic response analysis, the dynamic characteristics along both longitudinal and transverse directions are analyzed by eigenvalue analysis to figure out the natural behavior under the dead load. The nonlinear dynamic response analysis is conducted under Hyogoken Nanbu earthquake occurred in 1995. After detecting the critical sections as abutments the viscous dampers are installed to increase the seismic performance of the bridge under severe earthquakes. The comparative results between undamped and damped structures are presented in terms of acceleration and displacement values at the critical points to evaluate the advantages of dampers. By this research, an application of seismic retrofitting and isolation methods are presented.},

abstract = {In this paper, design sensitivity analysis methods for the transient response of nonviscously damped systems are considered. The damping forces of the non-viscously damped systems depend on the past history of motion via convolution integrals over some suitable kernel functions. The adjoint variable method (AVM) is adopted to develop the design sensitivity analysis. Two numerical solution schemes, namely the discretize-then-differentiate method and the differentiate-then-discretize method, are introduced to complete the AVM for the sensitivity analysis of non-viscously damped systems. The discretize-thendifferentiate AVM discretizes the equations of motion based on the Newmark-b implicit integration method ﬁrst and then differentiates the discrete equations. On the contrary, the differentiate-then-discretize AVM ﬁrstly differentiates the equations of motion after transforming it into a state-space form, and then discretizes the equations based on a modiﬁed precise integration method (PIM). The numerical accuracy, efﬁciency, consistency and implementation effort are discussed and compared. Two numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of both methods. The results indicate that, by considering both computational accuracy and efﬁciency, the PIM based differentiate-then-discretize method is more suitable than the Newmark-b based discretize-then-differentiate method for the sensitivity analysis of transient responses for non-viscously damped systems.},

abstract = {In cloud computing environment, in order to optimize the deployment scheduling of resources, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of the optimal solution, guarantee the convergence ability of the algorithm, and improve the performance of cloud computing. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on improved particle swarm is proposed. A multiobjective optimization model is built. Improved multi-scale particle swarm is used to optimize the built multi-objective model. The combination of the global search capability and the local search capability of the algorithm is realized by using Gaussian variation operator with varied scales. The large scale Gaussian variation operator with concussion characteristics can complete fast global search for decision space, so that particles can quickly locate the surrounding area of the optimal solution, which enhances the ability to escape the local optimal solution of the algorithm and avoids the occurrence of precocious convergence. The small scale variation operator gradually reduces the area near the optimal solution. Experimental results show that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm can eﬀectively improve the precision of the optimal solution and ensure the convergence of the algorithm.},

An approximate analytical solution for the amplitude-dependent effective damping ratios in each mode is developed by assuming the same form of solution as for the linear damper and minimizing the mean-square error in the force equilibrium at the damper. An asymptotic approximate solution for small frequency shifts reveals a nondimensional grouping of parameters allowing the development of an amplitude-dependent "universal estimation curve" for the power-law damper. The shape of the universal curve is slightly different for each value of the damper exponent, but for a given exponent the curve is nearly invariant over the same range of parameters as the universal curve for the linear damper. This formulation yields insights into the dependence of nonlinear damper performance on mode number and amplitude of oscillation, suggesting potential advantages that may be offered by a nonlinear damper over a traditional linear damper.},

abstract = {Many investigations have been done on low velocity and frequency applications of MR devices. The main purpose of this paper was to analyze the behaviour of the longstroke MR damper under impact load and establish its dynamic model. Their relationships between some important designed parameters have been investigated in detail. According to the simulation result, a novel large-scale single-ended MR damper without the accumulator was designed and developed as the specimen. In order to simulate MR damper's performance under impact load, fuzzy controller and fuzzy PID controller were exploited to evaluate their controllability. Besides, a suit of intelligent monitoring and controlling system which used a closed bump to produce an impact load for MR damper was designed and exploited. Experiment results indicated that the designed MR damper could effectively reduce the shock vibration and achieve good control effect. Compared to other control methods, the fuzzy control strategy could reduce off 20% its displacement and pressure of MR damper under impact load.},

@article{Dallard2001a,
abstract = {This paper starts by describing the structure of the London Millennium Footbridge. The bridge opened on 10 June 2000. During the opening day unexpected lateral movements occurred as pedestrians crossed the bridge. The paper describes the events of opening day and the research and analysis that were carried out as a result of these movements. The lateral force exerted by pedestrians on the moving deck surface is found to be related to the movement. The results show that the phenomenon is not related to the technical innovations of the bridge and that the same phenomenon could occur on any bridge with a lateral frequency below about 1.3Hz loaded with a sufficient number of pedestrians. A selection of other bridges, including one road bridge, found to have exhibited the same phenomenon, are listed. The paper describes the development of a retrofit to control the vibrations. This involves the use of fluid-viscous dampers and tuned mass dampers to achieve damping levels in excess of 20% of critical. The results of tests on the bridge with a prototype installation of a small number of the proposed dampers are presented, which show that the performance of the damping scheme conforms with analytical predictions.},

Considering the continuity conditions, the in-plane nonlinear motion equations of the cable-stayed beam are obtained via the Hamilton principle. Then, utilizing the method of multiple scales, the modulation equations that govern the nonlinear dynamics of the cable-stayed beam are derived. These equations are then utilized to investigate the effect of control gain and time delay on the amplitude and frequency response behavior. Depending on the excitation amplitude and the commensurability of the delayed-response frequency to the excitation frequency, it can be demonstrated that appropriate choice for the feedback gain can greatly reduce the response amplitude of the primary resonance. Finally, numerical simulation is also given to determine the optimal value for control gain and time delays that can improve the vibrations suppression efﬁciency.},

The accepted standard for a dynamic test is a modal analysis, which derives a description of the dynamics in terms of natural frequencies, damping ratios, and modeshapes. This article discusses how such features can be used to extract a damage diagnosis. From a modal test, it is possible to extract the physical matrices that enter the structural equations of motion: mass, damping, and stiffness matrices. This article also describes damage identification strategies based on these matrices.},

abstract = {The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a recently invented evolutionary computation technique which is gaining popularity owing to its simplicity in implementation and rapid convergence. In the case of single-peak functions, PSO rapidly converges to the peak; however, in the case of multi-modal functions, the PSO particles are known to get trapped in the local optima. In this paper, we propose a variation of the algorithm called Parallel Swarms Oriented Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-PSO) which consists of a multi-stage and a singlestage of evolution. In the multi-stage of evolution, individual sub-swarms evolve independently in parallel and in the single-stage of evolution the sub-swarms exchange information to search for the global best. The two interweaved stages of evolution demonstrate better performance on test functions, especially of higher dimensions. The attractive feature of the PSO-PSO version of the algorithm is that it does not introduce any new parameters to improve its convergence performance. The strategy maintains the simple and intuitive structure as well as the implemental and computational advantages of the basic PSO.},

Compared with the weighted path graph, the weighted horizontal visibility graph (WHVG) can reﬂect the dynamics characteristics of vibration signals better. When the fault bearing vibration signal is transformed into the WHVG, GFT can cluster most of the fault impulse component to the highest order range and has strong anti-interference ability. Based on WHVG and GFT, a novel fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings is proposed. In the proposed method, the graph spectrum coefﬁcients in the highest order range are extracted to reconstruct the fault impulse component, and then the Hilbert envelope spectrum is used to diagnose the bearing fault. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings is noise tolerant and effective.},

Based on these ‘optimal complex modes', an index of damping non-proportionality is proposed. The methodologies developed here are applicable to both viscous and non-viscously damped systems. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the developed concepts.},

abstract = {Wind and seismic resistance design are two critical elements in structural design of long-span cable stayed bridges. In order to investigate the inﬂuences of the originally equipped seismic viscous dampers on the wind-resistant performance of bridges, full bridge aeroelastic wind tunnel tests have been carried out on the overall scaled model of Hangzhou Bay Cable Stayed Bridge. It is found that the bridge exhibits good wind-resistant performance, while seismic viscous dampers have very minor effects on the vertical buffeting displacement of the mid-span girder. The study also shows that optimizing the damper parameters could only slightly improve the ability of the dampers to reduce wind vibrations. Therefore, when designing long span cable stayed bridges, the bridge seismic design and wind-resistant design can be carried out separately, without considering the wind-resistant effects of the dampers which aim at dissipating earthquake energy.},

abstract = {In this paper the use of the Tuned Mass Damper Inerter (TMDI) to control the response of base isolated structures under stochastic horizontal base acceleration is examined. Notably, the TMDI, recently introduced as a generalization of the classical Tuned Mass Damper, allows to achieve enhanced performance compared to the other passive vibration control devices. Thus, it represents an ideal alternative for reducing displacements of base isolated structures. To this aim, ﬁrstly a straightforward numerical approach is developed for the optimal design of this device considering a white noise base excitation. Further, a simpliﬁed analytical solution for the optimal design of TMDI parameters for base isolated structures is proposed minimizing the displacement variance of the corresponding undamped base isolated system. A thorough numerical analysis is performed and related results, in terms of optimal parameters and control performance, are compared with pertinent data obtained by a more computationally demanding iterative optimization procedure on the original damped system, considering both white noise and coloured noise stationary base excitation. Analytical and numerical results are found in good agreement, especially in terms of control performance, thus establishing the reliability and efﬁciency of the proposed approach. Finally, numerical analyses on a ﬁve-story benchmark base isolated structure controlled with an optimally designed TMDI are performed considering real recorded ground motions as base excitation. It is concluded that the TMDI, properly optimized with the proposed procedure, can effectively reduce the response of base isolated structures even under strong earthquakes.},

@article{Blackwell2019,
abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has two salient components: 1) a dynamical rule governing particle motion and 2) an interparticle communication topology. Recent practice has focused on the fully connected topology (Gbest) despite earlier indications on the superiority of local particle neighborhoods. This paper seeks to address the controversy with empirical trials with canonical PSO on a large benchmark of functions, categorized into 14 properties. This paper confirms the early lore that Gbest is the overall better algorithm for unimodal and separable problems and that a ring neighborhood of connectivity two (Lbest) is the preferred choice for multimodal, nonseparable and composition functions. Topologies of intermediate particle connectivity were also tested and the difference in global/local performance was found to be even more marked. A measure of significant improvement is introduced in order to distinguish major improvements from refinements. Lbest, according to the experiments on the 84 test functions and a bi-modal problem of adjustable severity, is found to have significant improvements later in the run, and to be more diverse at termination. A mobility study shows that Lbest is better able to jump between optimum basins. Indeed Gbest was unable to switch basins in the bi-modal trial. The implication is that Lbest's larger terminal diversity, its better ability to basin hop and its later significant improvement account for the performance enhancement. In several cases where Lbest was not the better algorithm, the trials show that Lbest was not stuck but would have continued to improve with an extended evaluation budget. Canonical PSO is a baseline algorithm and the ancestor of all contemporary PSO variants. These variants build on the basic structure of baseline PSO and the broad conclusions of this paper are expected to follow through. In particular, research that fails to consider local topologies risks underplaying the success of the promoted algorithm.},

abstract = {When performing vibration tests on civil engineering structures, it is often unpractical and expensive to use artificial excitation (shakers, drop weights). Ambient excitation on the contrary is freely available (traffic, wind), but it causes other challenges. The ambient input remains unknown and the system identification algorithms have to deal with output-only measurements. For instance, realization algorithms can be used: originally formulated for impulse responses they were easily extended to output covariances. More recently, data-driven stochastic subspace algorithms which avoid the computation of the output covariances were developed. The key element of these algorithms is the projection of the row space of the future outputs into the row space of the past outputs. Also typical for ambient testing of large structures is that not all degrees of freedom can be measured at once but that they are divided into several set-ups with overlapping reference sensors. These reference sensors are needed to obtain global mode shapes. In this paper, a novel approach of stochastic subspace identification is presented that incorporates the idea of the reference sensors already in the identification step: the row space of future outputs is projected into the row space of past reference outputs. The algorithm is validated with real vibration data from a steel mast excited by wind load. The price paid for the important gain concerning computational efficiency in the new approach is that the prediction errors for the non-reference channels are higher. The estimates of the eigenfrequencies and damping ratios do not suffer from this fact.},

abstract = {The paper presents the scope of load tests carried out on an innovative shell composite footbridge. The tested footbridge was manufactured in one production cycle and has no components made from materials other than GFRP laminates and PET foam. The load tests, performed on a 14-m long structure, were the final stage of a research program in the Fobridge project carried out in cooperation with: Gda{\'{n}}sk University of Technology (leader), Military University of Technology in Warsaw, and ROMA Co. Ltd.; and co-financed by NCBR. The aim of the tests was to confirm whether the complex U-shape sandwich structure behaves correctly. The design and technological processes involved in constructing this innovative footbridge required the solving of many problems: absence of standards for design of composite footbridges, lack of standardized material data, lack of guidelines for calculation and evaluation of material strength, and no guidelines for infusion of large, thick sandwich elements. Obtaining answers during the design process demanded extensive experimental tests, development of material models, validation of models, updating parameters and extensive numerical parametric studies. The technological aspects of infusion were tested in numerous trials involving the selection of material parameters and control of the infusion parameters. All scientific validation tests were successfully completed and market assessment showed that the proposed product has potential applications; it can be used for overcoming obstacles in rural areas and cities, as well as in regions affected by natural disasters. Load testing included static and dynamic tests. During the former, the span was examined at 117 independent measurement points. The footbridge was loaded with concrete slabs in different configurations. Their total weight ranged from 140 kN up to 202 kN. The applied load at the most heavily loaded structural points caused an effect from 89% to 120%, compared to the load specified by standards (5 kN/m2). Dynamic tests included standard actions (walking, running, synchronous jumps) as well as aggressive tests, all designed to confirm the usability of the footbridge. The performed trials allowed the identification of the modal and damping parameters of the structure. The designated first natural frequency with a value of 7.8 Hz confirmed the correctness of the U-shape cross-section design due to its significant structural rigidity.},

abstract = {The interaction of walking people with large vibrating structures, such as footbridges and ﬂoors, in the vertical direction is an important yet challenging phenomenon to describe mathematically. Several different models have been proposed in the literature to simulate interaction of stationary people with vibrating structures. However, the research on moving (walking) human models, explicitly identiﬁed for vibration serviceability assessment of civil structures, is still sparse. In this study, the results of a comprehensive set of FRFbased modal tests were used, in which, over a hundred test subjects walked in different group sizes and walking patterns on a test structure. An agent-based model was used to simulate discrete trafﬁc-structure interactions. The occupied structure modal parameters found in tests were used to identify the parameters of the walking individual's singledegree-of-freedom (SDOF) mass-spring-damper model using ‘reverse engineering' methodology. The analysis of the results suggested that the normal distribution with the average of l = 2.85Hz and standard deviation of r = 0.34Hz can describe human SDOF model natural frequency. Similarly, the normal distribution with l = 0.295 and r = 0.047 can describe the human model damping ratio. Compared to the previous studies, the agent-based modelling methodology proposed in this paper offers signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in simulating multi-pedestrian walking trafﬁcs, external forces and simulating different mechanisms of human-structure and human-environment interaction at the same time.},

It is supposed that the damping forces depend on the past history of velocities via convolution integrals over some kernel functions. The traditional restriction of symmetry has not been imposed on the system matrices. The nature of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is discussed under certain simpliﬁed but physically realistic assumptions concerning the system matrices and kernel functions. A numerical method for calculation of the right and left eigenvectors is suggested. The transfer function matrix of the system is derived in terms of the right and left eigenvectors of the second-order system. Exact closed-form expressions for the dynamic response due to general forces and initial conditions are presented. The proposed method uses neither the state-space approach nor additional dissipation coordinates. Suitable examples are given to illustrate the derived results.},

Reduction of labor costs with an increase in the reliability of information about the state of damage and technical condition is an actual scientific and practical task. One of the ways to solve it is to use non-destructive vibration diagnostic methods. The purpose of carrying out diagnostics with the use of vibration based damage detection methods is to search for damages in structural elements that can cause the deviation of the dynamic parameters of a structure from calculated ones. Determination of the dynamic parameters of the structure, in particular natural frequencies and mode shapes of mechanical systems, is one of the most important tasks that allows obtaining integral information about the state of a structure. This article presents the results of calculations for the localization of slabs defects in a multi-storey building with a transverse crack, span L = 4.5 (m), height H = 0.2 (m), with prestressed reinforcement d = 0.05 (m). Vibration based Damage Index method was used to localize the defect.

In particular, a local vibration testing method was proposed, along with a numerical means for characterizing the test results. In reinforced concrete (RC) beam specimens with a void, the local resonant frequency decreased over the void region as its length increased. This implies that the void locations and conditions can be identified from the resonant frequency distribution obtained from local vibration testing. Furthermore, in RC beam specimens reinforced with carbon fiber sheets, internal voids can be also identified using the testing method, even though one face of the RC member is covered with the sheets.},

abstract = {Footbridges usually suffer from vibrations induced by the actions of pedestrians, which calls for various control measures to improve the serviceability. This study described the dynamic analysis and Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) implementation for a singlepylon cable-stayed footbridge scaled model, aimed at providing an experimental case study regarding of vibration control design of slender structures. A scaled model for the real footbridge was designed based on similarity principles. Then, the dynamic behavior of the footbridge was assessed by ambient vibration tests. The natural frequencies and mode shapes were identified from operational vibration measurements by covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification algorithm. The frequency of first vertical bending modes is 2.10 Hz, falling into the human walking frequency range [1.6, 2.4] Hz. Therefore, the footbridge needs vibration control to improve its serviceability. Finally, a self-made TMD using lead, spring and oil buffer was implemented on the scaled model of the footbridge. The laboratory forced vibration test was employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the TMD. By installing TMD, the acceleration response at mid-span of the footbridge was remarkably reduced. The study could provide meaningful reference for vibration control design of the full-scale footbridge.},

abstract = {The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic based on populations of individuals in which solution candidates evolve through simulation of a simplified model of social adaptation. By aggregating robustness, efficiency and simplicity, PSO has gained great popularity. Modified PSO algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems with domain, linear and nonlinear constraints. Other algorithms that use multi-objective optimization to deal with constrained problems face the problem of not being able to guarantee finding feasible solutions. Current PSO algorithms that deal with constraints only treat domain constraints by controlling the velocity of particle displacement in the swarm, or do so inefficiently by randomly resetting each infeasible particle. This approach may make it infeasible to optimize certain problems, especially real ones. This work presents a new particle swarm optimization algorithm, called PSO+, capable of solving problems with linear and nonlinear constraints in order to solve these deficiencies. The proposed algorithm uses a feasibility repair operator and two swarms to ensure there will always be a swarm whose particles fully respect every constraint. A new particle update method is also proposed to insert diversity into the swarm and improve search-space coverage, allowing the search-space border to be exploited as well, which is particularly convenient when the optimization involves active constraints in global optimum. Two heuristics are proposed to initialize a feasible swarm with the purpose of speeding up the initialization mechanism and ensuring diversity at the starting point of the optimization process. Furthermore, a neighborhood topology is proposed to minimize premature convergence. The proposed algorithm was tested for twenty-four benchmark functions, as well as in a real reservoir drainage plan optimization problem. Results attest that the new algorithm is competitive, since it increases the efficiency of the PSO and the speed of convergence.},

abstract = {A gradient-based method for optimizing non-uniformly distributed multiple tuned mass damper (MTMD) is presented in this paper. By solving an optimization problem with multiple objectives, optimized non-uniformly distributed MTMDs are obtained. Then the dynamic characteristics, effectiveness, robustness and redundancy of MTMDs are investigated in detail. Without restrictive assumptions such as uniformly distributed frequency, identical damping ratio, the optimized non-uniformly MTMDs obtained here can be considered as the ‘‘true'' optimal ones. Unlike the references [L. Zuo, S.A. Nayfeh, Optimization of the individual stiffness and damping parameters in multiple-tuned-mass–damper system, Journal of Vibration and Acoustics—Transactions of the ASME 127(1) (2005) 77–83; N. Hoang, P. Warnitchai, Design of multiple tuned mass damper by using a numerical optimizer, Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics 34(2) (2005) 125–144], the maximum displacement or frequency response of the main structure is chosen as the objective function in the present paper, because the maximum displacement is more concerned than the root-mean-square response sometimes. Using the presented method, the errors of estimate of the parameters of the structure and the MTMD can be taken into account quantitatively in the design procedure of the MTMD. It is demonstrated that the MTMDs designed in this paper are more effective than the traditional optimal uniformly distributed MTMDs whose frequency spacing, stiffness or mass and damping are under some restrictions for simplicity. And the MTMDs designed by accounting for possible errors of estimate are more robust than those without consideration of errors.},

Next, a mode-shape-based damage detection (MBDD) method is outlined. A damage index algorithm to localize and estimate the severity of damage from monitoring changes in modal strain energy is formulated. The FBDD method and the MBDD method are evaluated for several damage scenarios by locating and sizing damage in numerically simulated prestressed concrete beams for which two natural frequencies and mode shapes are generated from ﬁnite element models. The result of the analyses indicates that the FBDD method and the MBDD method correctly localize the damage and accurately estimate the sizes of the cracks simulated in the test beam.},

This paper reviews and examines these methods of computing eigenderivatives for undamped, viscously damped, nonviscously damped, fractional and nonlinear vibration systems, as well as defective systems, for both distinct and repeated eigenvalues. The underlying mathematical relationships among these methods are discussed, together with new theoretical developments. Major important applications of eigenderivatives to ﬁnite element model updating, structural design and modiﬁcation prediction, performance optimization of structures and systems, optimal control system design, damage detection and fault diagnosis, as well as turbine bladed disk vibrations are examined. Existing difﬁculties are identiﬁed and measures are proposed to rectify them. Various examples are given to demonstrate the key theoretical concepts and major practical applications of concern.

abstract = {Frame structures with viscoelastic (VE) dampers mounted on them are considered in this paper. It is the aim of this paper to compare the dynamic characteristics of frame structures with VE dampers when the dampers are modelled by means of different models. The classical rheological models, the model with the fractional order derivative, and the complex modulus model are used. A relatively large structure with VE dampers is considered in order to make the results of comparison more representative. The formulae for dissipation energy are derived. The finite element method is used to derive the equations of motion of the structure with dampers and such equations are written in terms of both physical and state-space variables. The solution to motion equations in the frequency domain is given and the dynamic properties of the structure with VE dampers are determined as a solution to the appropriately defined eigenvalue problem. Several conclusions concerning the applicability of a family of models of VE dampers are formulated on the basis of results of an extensive numerical analysis.},

abstract = {Bridges are the lifelines of disasters in earthquake areas. Therefore, it is very necessary to ensure the safety and traffic function after earthquake. Seismic isolation refers to install external energy dissipation devices or external energy input devices in specific parts of engineering structures. There are certain differences in longitudinal and transverse seismic responses of multi-span continuous beam bridges by changing the seismic dynamic characteristics or dynamic effects of structures. It is difficult to achieve the purpose of seismic isolation in both horizontal directions using isolation devices alone. The rubber deformation ability of lead rubber bearings can effectively insulate, and the yield energy consumption ability of its lead core can effectively consume the seismic energy for damping. The horizontal resistance is very small under the creep load, and the stiffness decreases rapidly after yielding under the strong dynamic earthquake load; meanwhile, the seismic energy is dissipated by the hysteresis of bearing. Fluid viscous damper is a velocity-dependent energy dissipation device, which produces viscous damping force, provides strong restoring force for components, and has a good limit function. This process will also dissipate the seismic energy, so as to reduce the structural earthquake response. Using these two methods together, the horizontal seismic responses of multi-span continuous beam bridges can be effectively controlled at the same time. Based on this idea, this article takes a high-speed multi-span continuous beam bridge with equal section as the engineering background, and uses dynamic time history analysis method to discuss the seismic isolation effect of lead rubber bearings and fluid viscous dampers.},

abstract = {This paper presents an interactive framework for the design of truss structures with aesthetic criteria. The truss chords are described using NURBS, a tool widely used in computer aided design (CAD) programs to describe free-form geometry. This allows for a convenient interface between the optimization scheme, a particle swarm optimizer, and the user. Driven from the fact that aesthetic design goals are not easily quantifiable, key elements are introduced and implemented herein towards an interactive framework for algorithmic design of truss structures. Within this framework, the user can visually assess interesting solutions, save them for later assessment, actively drive the optimization towards individual aims, re-initialize the optimization with a set of available solutions, or restart the design process. A criterion is introduced as a means of quantifying subjective goals, expressing the similarity of the shape of candidate solutions with respect to reference designs. The framework is tested on a benchmark case and then applied to the design of a truss tower. The effectiveness of the similarity criteria, as well as the ability of the user to drive the process towards specific design goals is demonstrated.},

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary algorithm inspired by animal social behaviour. PSO achieves performance by iteratively directing its particles toward the optimum using its social and cognitive components. Various modifications have been applied to PSO focusing on addressing a variety of methods for adjusting PSO's parameters (i.e., parameter adjustment), social interaction of the particles (i.e., neighbourhood topology) and ways to address the search objectives (i.e., sub-swarm topology). The PSO approach can easily fit in different search optimization categories such as Self Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Stochastic Search, Population- based, and Behaviour-based Search. This study addresses these principal aspects of PSO. In addition, conventional and Basic PSO are introduced and their shortcomings are discussed. Later on, various suggestions and modifications proposed by literature are introduced and discussed.},

In this paper, accurate asymptotic formulas are analytically derived for the modal damping ratio of a general cable. The formulation includes the parameters mentioned above and is appropriate for a damper having a ﬁnite support stiffness. For a viscous damper, the inﬂuential parameters are explicitly incorporated as reduction and modiﬁcation factors in the modal damping formula, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the design procedure for stay cables. The analytical results are also extended to high-damping rubber dampers which have recently been encountered in practice. Finally, important formulas relevant to the design of both types of dampers are tabulated.},

abstract = {The paper deals with the dynamic analysis of multiply supported continuous beams subjected to moving loads, which in turn can be modelled either as moving forces or moving masses. A dedicated variant of the component mode synthesis (CMS) method is proposed in which the classical primary–secondary substructure approach (SA) is tailored to cope with slender (i.e. Euler–Bernoulli) continuous beams with arbitrary geometry. To do this, the whole structure is ideally decomposed in primary and secondary spans with convenient restraints, whose exact eigenfunctions are used as assumed local modes; the representation of the internal forces is improved with the help of two additional assumed modes for each primary span, while primary–secondary inﬂuence functions allow satisfying the kinematical compatibility between adjacent spans; the continuous beam is then re-assembled, and the Lagrange's equations of motion are derived in a compact block-matrix setting for both moving force and moving mass model. Numerical examples demonstrate accuracy and efﬁciency of the proposed procedure. An application with a platoon of high-speed moving masses conﬁrms that the inertial effects neglected in the moving force model may have a signiﬁcant impact in the structural response.},

The axial load which the guys apply to the tower, bearings, and foundations is an undesirable consequence of using guys to support the turbine. Limiting the axial load so that it does not significantly affect the cost of the turbine is an important objective of the cable design. The lateral vibration of the cables is another feature of the cable design which needs to be considered.

abstract = {The dynamic response of a concrete railway arch bridge is studied through a case study of the bridge over Kalix River, situated at L{\aa}ngforsen on the railway line between Kalix and Morj{\"{a}}rv in northern Sweden. A simplified beam-element model, a spatial grillage-beam model and a refined shell-element model were built to analyze the bridge structure. A methodology was applied where measured static and dynamic responses were used to update finite element models of L{\aa}ngforsen Bridge. A multi-response objective function was presented, and the finite element method was proved feasible by comparison of predicted and measured response. In the paper comparative analyses were made of the time history displacement of three finite element models under three measured load cases. A standard train model from EUROCODE, HSLM-A 1, was applied and the dynamic responses under different speeds were studied. The results showed that a refined shell element model could accurately analyze dynamic responses of the concrete railway arch bridge in a better way than beam element and spatial grillage models. The dynamic analysis based on this type of shell model can give an optimized suggestion for the railway operation as well as for the design of high-speed railway bridges.},

A ﬁnite-volume method is applied to solve the radiative transfer equation of a direct problem to obtain measured temperatures.

The implemented approach comprises a combination of the linear quadratic regulator with a nonlinear observer, namely, the unscented Kalman filter, for the control of systems described by uncertainties. Indeed, numerical models of structural systems often result as inadequate because of inherent uncertainties, such as noise, modeling errors, unknown system properties, or influence of varying operational and environmental conditions. In tackling this issue, the unscented Kalman filter is herein employed for adaptive joint state and parameter estimation refining the accuracy of the model employed by the controller and resulting in enhanced vibration mitigation. A scaled five-story shear frame attached to a hydraulic cylinder comprises the tested structure, where actuation is provided by means of a rotational magnetorheological damper operating on the relative motion between the ground floor and the first floor plate. The experimentally obtained results demonstrate a good agreement with simulations and encourage further implementation of the proposed framework in field applications of structural control.

abstract = {The lateral vibration serviceability of slender footbridges has been the subject of many studies over the last few decades. However, in spite of the large amount of research, a common criterion has not been set yet. Although the human–structure interaction phenomenon is widely accepted as the main cause of the sudden onset of high amplitudes of vibration, the current design recommendations do not include an expression for the auto-induced component of the pedestrian action and, as a consequence, it is not possible to evaluate the footbridge comfort once the lock-in eﬀect has developed. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to propose a general formulation, which allows the analysis of the diﬀerent load scenarios that the footbridge will experience during its overall life cycle. An important advantage over most current design guidelines is that the procedure permits the evaluation of the comfort level of the footbridge, even with crowd densities above the “critical number”, and thus takes informed decisions about the possible use of external devices to control the vibration response, depending on the probability of occurrence of the problem. The performance of the proposed method is successfully evaluated through numerical response simulations of two real footbridges, showing a good agreement with the experimental data.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has received increasing interest from the optimization community due to its simplicity in implementation and its inexpensive computational overhead. However, PSO has premature convergence, especially in complex multimodal functions. Extremal optimization (EO) is a recently developed local-search heuristic method and has been successfully applied to a wide variety of hard optimization problems. To overcome the limitation of PSO, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, called hybrid PSO–EO algorithm, through introducing EO to PSO. The hybrid approach elegantly combines the exploration ability of PSO with the exploitation ability of EO. We testify the performance of the proposed approach on a suite of unimodal/multimodal benchmark functions and provide comparisons with other meta-heuristics. The proposed approach is shown to have superior performance and great capability of preventing premature convergence across it comparing favorably with the other algorithms.},

abstract = {The dynamic characteristics of a multi-span pre-stressed concrete urban bridge before, during and after widening operations have been studied. The widening operations have been carried out by adding two new bridges on the either sides of the old bridge. The decks of the new bridges have been structurally separated from the old one by two longitudinal joints on the either side of the old bridge. The dynamic characteristics have been extracted from operational modal tests in three phases during different stages of the widening operations. The dynamic interaction between the new parts and the old part of the bridge has also been investigated. The results show that after the completion of the widening works, and when the whole bridge was placed in service condition, this interaction affects the natural frequencies of almost all the vibration modes of the bridge. It was also found that the longitudinal joints were unable to effectively isolate the new parts from the old part. Finally, in order to achieve a consistent behaviour in the first bending mode of the new and old bridges, a geometrical index has been introduced. This index includes both the effects of stiffness and mass properties of the bridge deck. In widening projects, where the span lengths, material properties and support conditions of the two bridges are taken the same, adopting equal geometrical indices leads to almost equal values of the natural frequencies and similar mode shapes in the first bending mode. The proposed index can be used in the initial design stage for such projects.},

abstract = {A vibration-based bridge scour detection procedure using a cantilever-based piezoelectric energy harvesting device (EHD) is proposed here. This has an advantage over an accelerometer-based method in that potentially, the requirement for a power source can be negated with the only power requirement being the storage and/or transmission of the data. Ideally, this source of power could be fulﬁlled by the EHD itself, although much research is currently being done to explore this. The open-circuit EHD voltage is used here to detect bridge frequency shifts arising due to scour. Using one EHD attached to the central bridge pier, both scour at the pier of installation and scour at another bridge pier can be detected from the EHD voltage generated during the bridge free-vibration stage, while the harvester is attached to a healthy pier. The method would work best with an initial modal analysis of the bridge structure in order to identify frequencies that may be sensitive to scour. Frequency components corresponding to harmonic loading and electrical interference arising from experiments are removed using the ﬁlter bank property of singular spectrum analysis (SSA). These frequencies can then be monitored by using harvested voltage from the energy harvesting device and successfully utilised towards structural health monitoring of a model bridge aﬀected by scour.},

Herein, the vehicle is simpliﬁed as a spring–damper–mass system and coupled to the bridge by its interactional force in the governing equations based on the Timoshenko beam theory. According to the symplectic orthogonality of the state vectors, the orthogonality of the mode shapes of the Timoshenko beams is proved, and the dynamic responses of the continuous beam bridges with different spans and variable cross sections can be solved by the mode superposition method. More complicated factors, such as harmonic load on vehicles, noise in measurement, and roughness of pavements, can also be conveniently taken into account. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated using some numerical examples and applied to a real bridge. The results indicate that the method is convenient, efﬁcient, and precise for engineering applications.},

abstract = {The numerical modeling of highly damped viscoelastic materials is critical for aerospace applications such as dynamic analysis of solid rocket motors – showing high damping ratios due to the presence of solid propellant – and design of passive damping devices for minimizing vibrations in aeronautical and space systems. Time-domain viscous damping models – giving damping forces proportional to velocities – are directly applicable in transient simulations, but they give a frequency-linear dissipative behavior which has no experimental evidence. On the other hand, frequency-domain hysteretic damping models – giving damping forces proportional to displacements – result in a frequency-constant dissipation that better describes the behavior of certain materials. However, using such models in transient analyses may give unphysical, non–Hermitian and non-causal system response. This paper reviews a class of ﬁrst-principle-based damping models commonly used in structural dynamics by deriving them as particular cases of a general continuum mechanics formulation. The proposed damping models are tuned, in their frequencydomain description, on material experimental data so providing a Hermitian and causal time-domain responses, and they are applied to highly damped, practical aerospace structures via Finite Element models. The proposed model is applied to two aerospace systems: a scaled-down test article dynamically representative of a solid rocket motor launchvehicle stage and a two-dimensional airfoil with passive viscoelastic dampers for ﬂutter suppression.},

abstract = {The ﬁeld non-destructive vibration test plays an important role in the area of structural health monitoring. It assists in monitoring the health status and reducing the risk caused by the poor performance of structures. As the most economic ﬁeld test among the various vibration tests, the ambient vibration test is the most popular and is widely used to assess the physical condition of a structure under operational service. Based on the ambient vibration data, modal identiﬁcation can help provide signiﬁcant previous study for model updating and damage detection during the service life of a structure. It has been proved that modal identiﬁcation works well in the investigation of the dynamic performance of diﬀerent kinds of structures. In this paper, the objective structure is a highrise multi-function oﬃce building. The whole building is composed of seven three-story structural units. Each unit comprises one complete ﬂoor and two L shaped ﬂoors to form large spaces along the vertical direction. There are 56 viscous dampers installed in the building to improve the energy dissipation capacity. Due to the special feature of the structure, ﬁeld vibration tests and further modal identiﬁcation were performed to investigate its dynamic performance. Twenty-nine setups were designed to cover all the degrees of freedom of interest. About two years later, another ﬁeld test was carried out to measure the building for 48 h to investigate the performance variance and the distribution of the modal parameters. A Fast Bayesian FFT method was employed to perform the modal identiﬁcation. This Bayesian method not only provides the most probable values of the modal parameters but also assesses the associated posterior uncertainty analytically, which is especially relevant in ﬁeld vibration tests arising due to measurement noise, sensor alignment error, modelling error, etc. A shaking table test was also implemented including cases with and without dampers, which assists in investigating the eﬀect of dampers. The modal parameters obtained from diﬀerent tests were investigated separately and then compared with each other.},

abstract = {In many ﬁelds one encounters the challenge of identifying, out of a pool of possible designs, those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. This means that usually there is not one optimal design but an entire set of Pareto-optimal ones with optimal tradeoﬀs in the objectives. In many applications, evaluating one design is expensive; thus, an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is unfeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the Pareto Active Learning (PAL) algorithm which intelligently samples the design space to predict the Pareto-optimal set. Key features of PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as samples from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accomodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we show an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets. The results show PAL's eﬀectiveness; in particular it improves signiﬁcantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in many cases about 33% evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.},

abstract = {Modal parameter identification is used to identify those parameters of the model which describe the dynamic properties of a vibration system. Classical modal parameter extractions usually require measurements of both the input force and the resulting response in laboratory conditions. However, when large-scale operational structures are subjected to random and unmeasured forces such as wind, waves, or aerodynamics, modal parameters estimation must base itself on response-only data. Over the past years, many time-domain modal parameter identification techniques from output-only have been proposed. Among them, the natural excitation technique (NExT) has been a very powerful tool for the modal analysis of structures excited in operating environment. This issue reviews the theoretical development of natural excitation technique (NExT), which uses the cross-correlation functions of measured responses coupling with conventional time-domain parameter extraction under the assumption of white-noise random inputs. Then a frequency-domain poly reference modal identification scheme by coupling the cross-correlation technique with conventional frequency-domain poly reference modal parameter extraction is presented. It uses cross-power spectral density functions instead of frequency response functions and auto- and cross-correlation functions instead of impulse response functions to estimate modal parameters from response-only data. An experiment using an airplane model is performed to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-correlation technique coupled with frequency-domain poly reference modal identification scheme.

abstract = {Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques are among the most common approaches for structural damage identification. The presence of damage in structures may be identified by monitoring the changes in dynamic behavior subject to external loading, and is typically performed by using experimental modal analysis (EMA) or operational modal analysis (OMA). These tools for SHM normally require a limited number of physically attached transducers (e.g. accelerometers) in order to record the response of the structure for further analysis. Signal conditioners, wires, wireless receivers and a data acquisition system (DAQ) are also typical components of traditional sensing systems used in vibration-based SHM. However, instrumentation of lightweight structures with contact sensors such as accelerometers may induce mass-loading effects, and for large-scale structures, the instrumentation is labor intensive and time consuming. Achieving high spatial measurement resolution for a large-scale structure is not always feasible while working with traditional contact sensors, and there is also the potential for a lack of reliability associated with fixed contact sensors in outliving the life-span of the host structure. Among the state-of-the-art noncontact measurements, digital video cameras are able to rapidly collect high-density spatial information from structures remotely. In this paper, the subtle motions from recorded video (i.e. a sequence of images) are extracted by means of Phase-based Motion Estimation (PME) and the extracted information is used to conduct damage identification on a 2.3-meter long Skystream{\textregistered} wind turbine blade (WTB). The PME and phased-based motion magnification approach estimates the structural motion from the captured sequence of images for both a baseline and damaged test cases on a wind turbine blade. Operational deflection shapes of the test articles are also quantified and compared for the baseline and damaged states. In addition, having proper lighting while working with high-speed cameras can be an issue, therefore image enhancement and contrast manipulation has also been performed to enhance the raw images. Ultimately, the extracted resonant frequencies and operational deflection shapes are used to detect the presence of damage, demonstrating the feasibility of implementing non-contact video measurements to perform realistic structural damage detection.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new approach is developed for structural shape optimization, which consists in coupling the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the isogeometric boundary element method (IGA-BEM). The IGA-BEM is based on the combination of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) and the boundary element method (BEM), where Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) are employed as shape functions for geometry parameterization and approximation of the ﬁeld variables. The method inherits the main advantage of the IGA-based shape optimization, i.e., the control points are used as design variables, thus the design model, analysis model and optimization model are uniformly described with the NURBS, providing easy communication between the three models and resulting in a smooth optimized boundary. However, the main feature of the proposed method is the use of PSO, which provides an attractive gradient-free alternative to complicated sensitivity analysis. The eﬃciency and accuracy of the proposed approach are demonstrated through four 2D shape optimization examples.},

These bridges were selected for dynamic ﬁeld measurements following a preliminary numerical evaluation that identiﬁed very high vertical accelerations. From the dynamic measurements it was possible to conclude that: (i) the damping due to friction between ballast particles and the friction in the supports plays an important role in the evaluation of maximum accelerations and (ii) the ﬁrst natural frequencies of the bridges vary according to the amplitude of vibration, that is, increasing vibration amplitudes correspond to a decrease of the ﬁrst natural frequency in a consistent way for all investigated bridges. Calibrated FE models for these bridges conﬁrmed the experimental conclusions.},

abstract = {Vehicles commuting over bridge structures respond dynamically to the bridge's vibrations. An acceleration signal collected within a moving vehicle contains a trace of the bridge's structural response, but also includes other sources such as the vehicle suspension system and surface roughness-induced vibrations. This paper introduces two general methods for the bridge system identiﬁcation using data exclusively collected by a network of moving vehicles. The contributions of the vehicle suspension system are removed by deconvolving the vehicle response in frequency domain. The ﬁrst approach utilizes the vehicle transfer function, and the second uses ensemble empirical modal decomposition (EEMD). Next, roughness-induced vibrations are extracted through a novel application of second-order blind identiﬁcation (SOBI) method. After these two processes, the resulting signal is equivalent to the readings of mobile sensors that scan the bridge's dynamic response. Structural modal identiﬁcation using mobile sensor data has been recently made possible with the extended structural modal identiﬁcation using expectation maximization (STRIDEX) algorithm. The processed mobile sensor data is analyzed using STRIDEX to identify the modal properties of the bridge. The performance of the methods are validated on numerical case studies of a long single-span bridge with a network of moving vehicles collecting data while in motion. The analyses consider three road surface roughness patterns. Results show that for long-span bridges with medium- to high-ongoing trafﬁc volume, the proposed algorithms are successful in extracting pure bridge vibrations, and produce accurate and comprehensive modal properties of the bridge. The study shows that the proposed transfer function method can efﬁciently deconvolve the linear dynamics of a moving vehicle. EEMD method is able to extract vehicle dynamic response without a priori information about the vehicle. In addition, proposed identiﬁcation methods provide secondary information about the roughness pattern and the vehicle. This study is the ﬁrst proposed methodology for complete bridge modal identiﬁcation, including operational natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios using moving vehicles sensor data.},

abstract = {Pedestrian-induced vibration commonly governs serviceability criteria in footbridge design. Simplified approaches to assess these vibrations have resulted in undesirable levels of vibration in built footbridges, highlighting the need to develop more realistic representations of the pedestrian loads as well as approaches to mitigate their effects. To represent these types of loads in an accurate manner it is necessary to consider the anthropometric characteristics (inter-subject variability), the inability that pedestrians have to transmit the same force in each step (intra-subject variability), the interaction between pedestrians and the lock-in effect. It has been observed that some footbridges have experiences serviceability problems due to vibrations with excessive magnitudes. In some of these cases, the human-induced vibration cannot be controlled effectively by using conventional approaches so the use of supplemental damping devices was required. Evaluation of the dynamic response at the design stage under the most realistic representation of pedestrian is crucial to satisfying the comfort criteria. After this evaluation, in cases where the comfort criteria is not fulfilled, an option available to designers is to employ supplemental damping devices to mitigate the pedestrian-induced vibrations. This work presents a parametric study showing the high efficiency of damping devices to mitigate human-induced vibrations in girder footbridges under diverse pedestrian loading scenarios.},

In addition, the paper describes the authors'experiences in initially constructing the FE models and conducting the updating itself. Finally, the practical meaning of the changes to the assumed model parameters, resulting from the updating, is discussed. It has been concluded that a period of manual updating should be conducted prior to implementing the automatic updating, as poor starting values may result in the automatic updating software producing unrealistic results.},

abstract = {This paper describes the work involving the implementation of a control system aimed at reducing vibrations in a slender footbridge located at FEUP campus. This structure was extensively studied in the past, mainly due to the clear exhibition of very perceptible vibrations induced by pedestrian loads. For that reason, a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) was installed in one of the spans of the structure for research purposes. Because the structure has several critical vibration modes with natural frequencies close to 2 Hz, only one device cannot act efficiently on all of them, which limits the control efficiency. In these cases, the option for a semiactive TMD seems to be appropriate, given the self‐tuning capabilities of these devices and even the possibility of performing multimode control. In this context, this document summarizes the work developed in studying, testing, and installing the passive TMD in the footbridge, as well as its migration to a semiactive system. Taking advantage of a continuous dynamic monitoring system installed in 2009, it was possible to evaluate the vibration levels of the structure measured over the past years, including the periods previous to and after the installation of the control solutions. A tendency was noted in the reduction of the peak accelerations of some sections of the deck after the installation of the passive TMD, which were even more attenuated with the activation of the semiactive system.},

abstract = {Dissipative mechanisms in linear multiple-degree-of-freedom viscoelastic systems are characterized by the dependence on the history of the velocity degrees-of-freedom via convolution integrals over kernel functions. As a result, damping matrices are frequencydependent and, in general, state-space approach based methods are widely used for their resolution. This paper proposes a new approach suitable for modelling such systems via a viscous model with proportional damping, which approximates the response of the original viscoelastic system using the undamped eigenvectors together with the complex eigenvalues with oscillatory nature, neglecting those modes with non-viscous nature (negative real eigenvalues). It is rigorously demonstrated that the transfer function of any viscoelastic system can be expanded as the sum of the transfer function of certain viscous model and a residual term. The obtained viscous model, named Equivalent Viscous Model, is characteristic of each viscoelastic system. In order to study the bound of the residual term two indexes are introduced to describe, on one hand, the non-proportionality, or the modal decoupling capability of the damping matrix and, on the other hand, the damping level of the system. The proposed viscous model is validated through numerical examples simulating different conditions of proportionality and damping.},

abstract = {In many real-world optimization problems, several conﬂicting objectives must be achieved and optimized simultaneously and the solutions are often required to satisfy certain restrictions or constraints. Moreover, in some applications, the numerical values of the objectives and constraints are obtained from computationally expensive simulations. Many multi-objective optimization algorithms for continuous optimization have been proposed in the literature and some have been incorporated or used in conjunction with expert and intelligent systems. However, relatively few of these multi-objective algorithms handle constraints, and even fewer, use surrogates to approximate the objective or constraint functions when these functions are computationally expensive. This paper proposes a surrogate-assisted evolution strategy (ES) that can be used for constrained multi-objective optimization of expensive black-box objective functions subject to expensive black-box inequality constraints. Such an algorithm can be incorporated into an intelligent system that ﬁnds approximate Pareto optimal solutions to simulation-based constrained multiobjective optimization problems in various applications including engineering design optimization, production management and manufacturing. The main idea in the proposed algorithm is to generate a large number of trial offspring in each generation and use the surrogates to predict the objective and constraint function values of these trial offspring. Then the algorithm performs an approximate non-dominated sort of the trial offspring based on the predicted objective and constraint function values, and then it selects the most promising offspring (those with the smallest predicted ranks from the non-dominated sort) to become the actual offspring for the current generation that will be evaluated using the expensive objective and constraint functions. The proposed method is implemented using cubic radial basis function (RBF) surrogate models to assist the ES. The resulting RBF-assisted ES is compared with the original ES and to NSGA-II on 20 test problems involving 2–15 decision variables, 2–5 objectives and up to 13 inequality constraints. These problems include well-known benchmark problems and application problems in manufacturing and robotics. The numerical results showed that the RBF-assisted ES generally outperformed the original ES and NSGA-II on the problems used when the computational budget is relatively limited. These results suggest that the proposed surrogate-assisted ES is promising for computationally expensive constrained multi-objective optimization.},

abstract = {Function evaluations (FEs) of many real-world optimization problems are time or resource consuming, posing a serious challenge to the application of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to solve these problems. To address this challenge, the research on surrogate-assisted EAs has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry over the past decades. However, most existing surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs) either still require thousands of expensive FEs to obtain acceptable solutions, or are only applied to very low-dimensional problems. In this paper, a novel surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimization (PSO) inspired from committee-based active learning (CAL) is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, a global model management strategy inspired from CAL is developed, which searches for the best and most uncertain solutions according to a surrogate ensemble using a PSO algorithm and evaluates these solutions using the expensive objective function. In addition, a local surrogate model is built around the best solution obtained so far. Then, a PSO algorithm searches on the local surrogate to ﬁnd its optimum and evaluates it. The evolutionary search using the global model management strategy switches to the local search once no further improvement can be observed, and vice versa. This iterative search process continues until the computational budget is exhausted. Experimental results comparing the proposed algorithm with a few state-of-the-art SAEAs on both benchmark problems up to 30 decision variables as well as an airfoil design problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve better or competitive solutions with a limited budget of hundreds of exact FEs.},

abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic search methods that mimic the natural biological evolution and/or the social behavior of species. Such algorithms have been developed to arrive at near-optimum solutions to large-scale optimization problems, for which traditional mathematical techniques may fail. This paper compares the formulation and results of ﬁve recent evolutionary-based algorithms: genetic algorithms, memetic algorithms, particle swarm, ant-colony systems, and shufﬂed frog leaping. A brief description of each algorithm is presented along with a pseudocode to facilitate the implementation and use of such algorithms by researchers and practitioners. Benchmark comparisons among the algorithms are presented for both continuous and discrete optimization problems, in terms of processing time, convergence speed, and quality of the results. Based on this comparative analysis, the performance of EAs is discussed along with some guidelines for determining the best operators for each algorithm. The study presents sophisticated ideas in a simpliﬁed form that should be beneﬁcial to both practitioners and researchers involved in solving optimization problems.},

abstract = {While numerous studies have been published concerning the application of a variety of system identification techniques in conjunction with vibration measurements from civil infrastructure systems, there is a paucity of publications addressing the influence of algorithm-specific control parameters that impact the correct and efficient application of the selected identification scheme. Furthermore, as dense sensor arrays become widely accessible in civil infrastructure applications, voluminous amounts of multichannel data streams are becoming available for processing, thus imposing new demands on identification procedures regarding high-dimensionality (in both the spatial as well as the temporal domains) requirements that may render some methods inapplicable if careful attention is not paid to practical implementation issues. This paper provides a comprehensive study of three time-domain identification algorithms applied in conjunction with the Natural Excitation Technique in order to extract the modal parameters of a newly constructed long-span bridge that was monitored, in its virgin state, over a relatively long period of time with a state-of-the-art dense sensor array. The three methods used are: the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), the ERA with data correlations, and the least squares algorithm. One of the critical issues in the mentioned algorithms, is selection of the reference degree-of-freedom (DOF). Previous experiences have shown that one cannot rely on a single reference DOF for identification of all modes. Consequently, the aforementioned identification formulations were modified to include multiple reference DOF, simultaneously, or one at a time. An autonomous algorithm was presented to distinguish the genuine structural modes from spurious noise or computational modes. Based on some parameter studies, some useful guidelines for the selection of critical user-selectable parameters are presented. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

@article{Li2011,
abstract = {The eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) is one of the most popular methods in civil engineering applications for estimating the modal parameters, including complex-valued modal frequencies and modal vectors, of dynamic systems. In dealing with noisy measurement data, the ERA partitions the realized model into principal (signal) and perturbational (noise) portions so that the noise portion can be disregarded. During the separation of signal and noise, a critical issue is the determination for the dimensions of the block Hankel matrix which is built from noisy measurement data. We show that the signal and noise matrices can be better separated when the number of blockrows and number of block-columns of the corresponding block Hankel matrix are chosen to be close to each other. We introduce the concept of using the Frobenius norm (L 2-norm) of the signal and noise matrices to quantify the signal to noise ratio in the global sense (involving multiple signals). We also propose a verification procedure to justify that the estimated modal parameters are noise insensitive and thus indeed associated with the true system. The procedure involves artificially injecting random noise into the measured signals (which are noisy signals) to create noisy-noisy signals, then comparing the identification results obtained respectively from the measured and noisynoisy signals. Using experimental data collected from a test plate, we demonstrate that if signal and noise portions have been properly separated while using the measured data, then the artificial noise would almost completely accumulate to the noise portion. Therefore, the modal estimation based on the signal portion only would remain the same by using either the measured or the noisy-noisy signals.},

This paper proposes a new variant of the ABC algorithm based on Von Neumann topology structure, namely Von Neumann Neighborhood Article Bee Colony (VABC). VABC significantly improves the original ABC in solving complex optimization problems. Clustering is a popular data analysis and data mining technique. The most popular technique for clustering is k-means algorithm. However, the k-means algorithm highly depends on the initial state and converges to local optimum solution. In this work, VABC algorithm is tested on a set of widely-used benchmark functions and is used for solve data clustering on several benchmark data sets. The performance of VABC algorithm is compared with ABC and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The simulation results show that the proposed VABC outperforms the other two algorithms in terms of accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed.},

The two major modal indicators, i.e. Modal Confidence Factor (MCF) and Modal Amplitude Coherence (MAmC) are extended to two-stage time domain modal identification algorithms, together with a newly developed indicator, named as Modal Participation Indicator (MPI). The application of the three indicators is illustrated on different cases of operational/ambient modal identification. Three major time domain modal identification algorithms are used the Polyreference Complex Exponential (PRCE), Extended Ibrahim Time Domain (EITD), Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA). The three identification algorithms are implemented from a unified point-of-view with the modal indicators. Numerical simulations are conducted on a two-story building structure and on an aircraft model and it is investigated how the modal indicators work to distinguish the physical modes from the computational modes.},
