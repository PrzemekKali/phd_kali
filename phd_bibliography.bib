	abstract = {Modal tests on large structures are often performed in multiple setups for practical reasons. Several sensors are kept fixed as reference sensors over all setups, while the other, so called roving sensors, are moved from one setup to another. This paper develops an optimal sensor placement strategy for multi-setup modal identification, which simultaneously optimizes the locations of the reference sensors and roving sensors. As an optimality criterion, the Information Entropy is adopted, which is a scalar measure of uncertainty in the Bayesian framework. The focus in the application goes to repetitive structures where modes typically occur in clusters, with closely spaced natural frequencies and similar wavelengths. The proposed strategy is illustrated for selecting optimal positions of uni-axial sensors for a repetitive frame structure. The influence of the number of reference sensors and two strategies for positioning roving sensors, i.e. a cluster and a uniform distribution of roving sensors, are investigated. The number of reference sensors is found to be preferably equal to or larger than the number of modes to be identified. In this case, the information content, as quantified by the Information Entropy, is not very sensitive to the roving sensor strategy. If less reference sensors are used, it is highly preferred to distribute the roving sensors uniformly over the structure instead of clustering them. The proposed strategy has been validated by an experimental modal test on a floor of an office building of KU Leuven, which has a nearly repetitive structural layout. The results show how optimally locating sensors allows extracting more information from the data. Though the focus is on applications involving repetitive structures, the proposed strategy can be applied to multi-setup modal identification of any large structure.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an improvement to the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) with natural excitation technique (NExT), which is called the ERA-NExT-AVG method. The method uses a coded average of row vectors in each Markov parameter for evaluating modal properties of a structure. The modification is important because, for the existing stochastic system identification methods, the state-space model, obtained from output sensor data, is usually overparameterized resulting in large systems. Solving such a problem can be computationally very intensive especially in the applications when using the computational capabilities of embedded sensor networks. As a way to improve the efficiency of the ERA-NExT method, the proposed method focuses on the number of components in a single Markov parameter, which can theoretically be minimized down to the number of structural modes. Applying the coded average column vectors as Markov parameters to the ERA, the computational cost of the algorithm is significantly reduced, whereas the accuracy of the estimates is maintained or improved. Numerical simulations are performed for a shear frame model subjected to Gaussian white noise ground excitation. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing the accuracy and computational cost of the estimated modal parameters using the proposed method, with several other stochastic modal identification methods including the ERA-observer Kalman filter identification, ERA-NExT, and autoregressive models. The performance of the method is then evaluated by applying it to ambient vibration data from the Golden Gate bridge, collected using a dense wireless sensor network, and its vertical and torsional modes are successfully and accurately identified.

Common inspection techniques are time consuming and hence can have strong economic implications due to aircraft downtime. As a result, during the past decade a number of methodologies have been proposed for detecting structural damage based on variations in the structure's dynamic characteristics. This paper describes the implementation of the natural excitation technique (NExT) combined with the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) to determine the dynamic characteristics of a T-34A Mentor acrobatic category aircraft and a modified DC-3 cargo/transport category aircraft. ??-Hight acceleration data were processed using NExT-ERA to monitor the predominant natural frequencies and associated mode shapes of the aircraft for varying flight conditions. The results show the effectiveness of this modal identification methodology and the possibility of implementing it in a real-time structural health monitoring system for aircraft.},

	abstract = {Modal parameter identification is used to identify those parameters of the model which describe the dynamic properties of a vibration system. Classical modal parameter extractions usually require measurements of both the input force and the resulting response in laboratory conditions. However, when large-scale operational structures are subjected to random and unmeasured forces such as wind, waves, or aerodynamics, modal parameters estimation must base itself on response-only data. Over the past years, many time-domain modal parameter identification techniques from output-only have been proposed. Among them, the natural excitation technique (NExT) has been a very powerful tool for the modal analysis of structures excited in operating environment. This issue reviews the theoretical development of natural excitation technique (NExT), which uses the cross-correlation functions of measured responses coupling with conventional time-domain parameter extraction under the assumption of white-noise random inputs. Then a frequency-domain poly reference modal identification scheme by coupling the cross-correlation technique with conventional frequency-domain poly reference modal parameter extraction is presented. It uses cross-power spectral density functions instead of frequency response functions and auto- and cross-correlation functions instead of impulse response functions to estimate modal parameters from response-only data. An experiment using an airplane model is performed to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-correlation technique coupled with frequency-domain poly reference modal identification scheme.

The routines implemented include the on-line automatic identification of the bridge’s natural frequencies with the Frequency Domain Decomposition method, enabling the tracking of the bridge’s first 12 natural frequencies.

Then, operational modal analysis using ambient vibrations is performed to attain dynamic characteristics experimentally. Human walking and wind are used as natural excitation. The output-only modal parameter identification is carried out using the Peak Picking method in frequency domain and the Stochastic Subspace Identification method in time domain. After, analytically and experimentally identified dynamic characteristics compared with each other and FEM of the historical bridge is updated to minimize the differences between modal parameters by changing uncertain modelling parameters such as boundary conditions. As a result, differences between the natural frequencies are reduced from 27\% to 3\% and good agreement is found between analytical and experimental dynamic characteristics after FEM updating.

This paper describes the strategy that was followed to minimize the effects of environmental and operational factors on the bridge natural frequencies, enabling, in a subsequent stage, the identification of structural anomalies. Alternative static and dynamic regression models are tested and complemented by a Principal Components Analysis. Afterwards, the identification of damages is tried with control charts.

A solution for instrumentation is autonomous ‘wireless’ recorders. The problem with signal interpretation is the reliability of the modal parameter estimates that is particularly challenged with low frequency modes, which ‘third generation’ operational modal analysis procedures offer using Bayesian approaches. The paper describes a preliminary exercise combining both these technologies in readiness for testing two very large bridges, one in China and one in Scotland.},

	abstract = {The mass and stiffness of the upper and lower structures of a powerhouse are different. As such, the first two vibration modes mostly indicate the dynamic characteristics of the upper structure, and the precise seismic response of a powerhouse is difficult to obtain on the basis of Rayleigh damping coefficients acquired using the fundamental frequencies of this structure. The damping ratio of each mode is relatively accurate when the least square method is used, but the accuracy of the damping ratios that contribute substantially to seismic responses is hardly ensured. The error of dynamic responses may even be amplified. In this study, modes that greatly influence these responses are found on the basis of mode participation mass, and Rayleigh damping coefficients are obtained. Seismic response distortion attributed to large differences in Rayleigh damping coefficients because of improper modal selection is avoided by using the proposed method, which is also simpler and more accurate than the least square method. Numerical experiments show that the damping matrix determined by using the Rayleigh damping coefficients identified by our method is closer to the actual value and the seismic response of the powerhouse is more reasonable than that revealed through the least square method.},

	abstract = {Rayleigh damping is commonly used to provide a source of energy dissipation in analyses of structures responding to dynamic loads such as earthquake ground motions. In a finite element model, the Rayleigh damping matrix consists of a mass-proportional part and a stiffness-proportional part; the latter typically uses the initial linear stiffness matrix of the structure. Under certain conditions, for example, a non-linear analysis with softening non-linearity, the damping forces generated by such a matrix can become unrealistically large compared to the restoring forces, resulting in an analysis being unconservative. Potential problems are demonstrated in this paper through a series of examples. A remedy to these problems is proposed in which bounds are imposed on the damping forces.

A basic problem is that the frequency area across which the damping ratio is almost constant is too narrow. If the area could be expanded, this would be one of an appropriate remedy for this problem. The author proposed a novel damping model capable of expanding the constant frequency area based on the study of a causal damping model. In this paper, the model is explained, first. Then, a time history response analysis is performed to confirm the effectivity of the model.},

	abstract = {Wind turbines are immense, flexible structures with aerodynamic forces acting on the rotating blades at harmonics of the turbine rotational frequency. These harmonics are comparable to the modal frequencies of the structure. Predicting and experimentally measuring the modal frequencies of wind turbines have been important to their successful design and operation. Performing modal tests on wind turbine structures over 100m tall is a substantial challenge, which has inspired innovative developments in modal test technology. For wind turbines, a further complication is that the modal frequencies are dependent on the turbine rotation speed. The history and development of a new technique for acquiring the modal parameters using output-only response data, called the Natural Excitation Technique (NExT), will be reviewed, showing historical tests and techniques. The initial attempts at output-only modal testing began in the late 1980s with the development of NExT in the 1990s. NExT was a predecessor to Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), developed to overcome these challenges of testing immense structures excited with natural environmental inputs. We will trace the difficulties and successes of wind turbine modal testing from 1982 to the present.},

In particular, the thought process that relates the original MAC development to ordinary coherence and to orthogonality computations will be explained.

	abstract = {Modal validation is of paramount importance for all two-stage time domain modal identification algorithms. However, due to a higher noise/signal ratio in operational/ambient modal analysis, being able to determine the right model order and to distinguish between structural modes and computational modes become more significant than in traditional modal analysis. The two major modal indicators, i.e. Modal Confidence Factor (MCF) and Modal Amplitude Coherence (MAmC) are extended to two-stage time domain modal identification algorithms, together with a newly developed indicator, named as Modal Participation Indicator (MPI). The application of the three indicators is illustrated on different cases of operational/ambient modal identification. Three major time domain modal identification algorithms are used the Polyreference Complex Exponential (PRCE), Extended Ibrahim Time Domain (EITD), Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA). The three identification algorithms are implemented from a unified point-of-view with the modal indicators. Numerical simulations are conducted on a two-story building structure and on an aircraft model and it is investigated how the modal indicators work to distinguish the physical modes from the computational modes.},

	abstract = {Previous experimental work has identified variations in the natural frequency and the modal damping ratio of the first vertical bending mode of vibration of a simply supported, single span steel–concrete composite bridge. It was found that the natural frequency decreased and the modal damping ratio increased with increasing amplitudes of vibration. This paper illustrates the influence of these variations on the train-bridge resonance of this particular bridge by means of a non-linear single degree of freedom system, based on the previously mentioned experimental results. As one might expect, the results indicate that the influence of the increasing damping ratio leads to a considerable decrease in the resonant amplitude whilst the decreasing natural frequency decreases the critical train speed at which resonance occurs. Further studies along this line of research may help us reduce the uncertainties in dynamic assessments of existing bridges based on dynamic measurements and improve our understanding of the dynamic properties of railway bridges in general.},

The response histories of the train and bridge are computed simultaneously by directly integrating the equation of motion of the entire virtual structure.

For these reasons its accurate assessment is a paramount task to be performed and hence the results of an experimental campaign carried out on a prestressed concrete (four box-girder) beam bridge of the new Italian high-speed network are presented in this work. A total amount of fifteen accelerometers were used to ensure redundancy of measurements. Both a time domain technique and a Frequency-Domain Decomposition (FDD) technique are used to analyse the vibration signals and extract the modal frequencies, shapes and damping ratio of the first mode of the structure. The results are compared with the design provisions, and with other expectation provided by the technical literature. The paper from one hand provides a contribution in the framework of the damping evaluation of high-speed railway bridges, and from the other hand would furnish a first assessment of those damping sources that are not usually accounted for in the modelling process.},

The true maximum load effect might occur at some other bridge section and its magnitude could be significantly greater. This paper quantifies the underestimation of the load effects as a result of exclusively considering the middle section, with special emphasis on resonant situations. A 2D numerical model of a vehicle–track–bridge system was used to evaluate different vehicle velocities, bridge properties and track irregularity conditions. The error due to the mid-span assumption depends on the particular case considered but can be related to the relative energy content of the higher modes of vibration. The results show that the error is greatest for accelerations, smaller for bending moments and is almost negligible for displacements.},

A simplified beam-element model, a spatial grillage-beam model and a refined shell-element model were built to analyze the bridge structure. A methodology was applied where measured static and dynamic responses were used to update finite element models of Långforsen Bridge. A multi-response objective function was presented, and the finite element method was proved feasible by comparison of predicted and measured response. In the paper comparative analyses were made of the time history displacement of three finite element models under three measured load cases. A standard train model from EUROCODE, HSLM-A 1, was applied and the dynamic responses under different speeds were studied. The results showed that a refined shell element model could accurately analyze dynamic responses of the concrete railway arch bridge in a better way than beam element and spatial grillage models. The dynamic analysis based on this type of shell model can give an optimized suggestion for the railway operation as well as for the design of high-speed railway bridges.},

These structures, though displaying a good performance under the eﬀect of service (gravity) loads but the seismic (lateral) loads have not been taken into account in their design; therefore, the seismic assessment of these structures is deemed necessary for obtaining their failure and seismic performance levels. So they can be strengthened or rendered out of order in case it is found necessary. There are numerous methods for evaluating the residual capacity of the structures under seismic excitation which among them the non-linear dynamic analysis or the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is the most accurate and perfect method. Selecting 22 far-ﬁeld earthquake records, the present study investigated two plain concrete arch bridges which are located in kilometers 23 and 24 of the old Tehran-Qom railway, respectively. By using the ﬁnite element method and the macro-modeling method the km-23 and km-24 bridges were simulated and totally 231 non-linear dynamic analyses have been conducted. The results obtained from the incremental dynamic analysis indicated that the seismic behavior of the bridge with longer span length is more vulnerable (km-23) than the bridge with lower span length (km-24). Generally, the seismic performance of plain concrete arch bridges has been found inappropriate, therefore to improve their performance it is necessary to retroﬁt these type of structures.},

The deflection and stress due to the bending moment were measured, and the location of the neutral axis of each section, the natural frequency, and the damping ratio were analyzed for three systems: girder only, ballast track, and concrete track with various stiffnesses of resilience pad of rail fastening system. Compared to the ballast track, the concrete track extended the location of the neutral axis of the structure by about 6\% in the upward direction. Moreover, the dynamic responses of the structure linearly increased with the maximum load and dramatically increased with the load amplitude during resonance. However, the damping ratio was the same with and without a track system. These results confirm the importance of a track system on the essential behavior of railway bridges, especially when a concrete track system is used.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of experimental measurements on a number of existing small to medium single span ballasted railway bridges in Austria. These bridges were selected for dynamic ﬁeld measurements following a preliminary numerical evaluation that identiﬁed very high vertical accelerations. From the dynamic measurements it was possible to conclude that: (i) the damping due to friction between ballast particles and the friction in the supports plays an important role in the evaluation of maximum accelerations and (ii) the ﬁrst natural frequencies of the bridges vary according to the amplitude of vibration, that is, increasing vibration amplitudes correspond to a decrease of the ﬁrst natural frequency in a consistent way for all investigated bridges. Calibrated FE models for these bridges conﬁrmed the experimental conclusions.},

The main feature of the element is that the effect of the ballast is introduced through a non-linear longitudinal stiffness associated to the slip at the interface between the bridge and the ballast. Two numerical applications show that this element can be used to model the variation of the natural frequencies of the bridge as a function of the amplitude of vibration.},

The use of the Harrington rods was limited, however, because of the need for long-segment instrumentation, distraction, and the potential for hood dislodgment and construct failure. Luque subsequently introduced the next generation of spinal fixation techniques via the concept of segmental instrumentation; his use of sublaminar wires allowed the construct to be fixated to the spine at every level. This arrangement allowed greater control over correction of spinal deformities and significantly lessened the incidence of hardware dislodgment. Modern instrumentation systems, including the use of pedicle screws, permit even greater control of the spine in multiple planes during deformity correction. Newer strategies have decreased the incidence of neurological injury during implant application and provide greater stability. A review of segmental fixation, including surgical techniques, is provided in this article.},

The infantile and adolescent types of scoliosis seem to share the same basic etiology, because their families contain instances of each.4. Infants with resolving scoliosis have affected relatives in the same proportions as in the main group, suggesting this is a mild form of the same disorder.5. In this series all infants seen with scoliosis under one year of age had plagiocephaly, which was usually transient.6. Mental defect and epilepsy are the commonest findings associated with scoliosis.7. In adolescent scoliosis the age of the mother is significantly raised by comparison with the expected figure for the normal population.},

	abstract = {Aiming at the characteristics of strong constraints of multiple knapsack problem (MKP), a method based on multiobjective particle swarm optimization is proposed in this paper. We take constraint violation as an optimal objective to avoid the troublesome of dealing with unfeasible solutions unsatisfied constraints. For updating effectively the external archive, the degree of constraint violation and the crowding degree of nondominated particle in Pareto front are taken as two criteria. To decrease the probability of algorithm converging to a pseudo Pareto front, a mutation operator is designed. The experimental results of solving a number of MKP instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better to the MKP instances with strong constraints.},

	abstract = {Temperature rise of an induction machine increases losses and decrease in the efﬁciency. The temperature rise depends on the machine design. It takes several hours after starting a machine to reach to thermal stability. In most of the in situ efﬁciency estimation methods, it is required to obtain the operating data of the machine at a thermally stable condition, which needs a long running time of the machine. In this paper, a method based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed, which can estimate the machine efﬁciency at different loads with thermal stability. The machine operation data at the ﬁrst 30 min after the start rather than data at a thermal stability condition are used in the method. The proposed algorithm utilizes two approaches to predict a full-load temperature at a thermally stable condition. The ﬁrst approach is based on the insulation class of the machine and uses the equivalent circuit. The second approach is based on the trend of the temperature rise in the ﬁrst 30 min of running the machine after the start. Furthermore, a method is proposed to narrow the parameters range, which helps the PSO to converge to the right answer. All results are validated by the experimental results.},

In addition, a mutation operator is incorporated to improve the exploratory capabilities of the algorithm.

The results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art constraint-handling techniques.

This algorithm uses two kinds of swarms, a main one that gathers the best particles of auxiliary ones, initialized several times. The auxiliary swarms are initialized in different areas, then an electrostatic repulsion heuristic is applied in each area to increase its diversity. We analyse the performance of the proposed approach on a testbed made of unimodal and multimodal test functions with and without coordinate rotation and shift. The Lennard-Jones potential problem is also used. The proposed algorithm is compared to several other PSO algorithms on this benchmark.

The most popular technique for clustering is k-means algorithm. However, the k-means algorithm highly depends on the initial state and converges to local optimum solution. In this work, VABC algorithm is tested on a set of widely-used benchmark functions and is used for solve data clustering on several benchmark data sets. The performance of VABC algorithm is compared with ABC and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms.

One subject of this program has been a short-span bridge taking a busy main road across a coastal inlet near a major port facility. Experiment-based structural assessments of the bridge were conducted before and after upgrading works including strengthening. Each assessment exercise comprised three separate components: ͑1͒ a strain and acceleration monitoring exercise lasting approximately one month; ͑2͒ a full-scale dynamic test carried out in a single day without closing the bridge; and ͑3͒ a ﬁnite-element model updating exercise to identify structural parameters and mechanisms. This paper presents the dynamic testing and the modal analysis used to identify the vibration properties and the quantiﬁcation of the effectiveness of the upgrading through the subsequent model updating. Before and after upgrade, similar sets of vibration modes were identiﬁed, resembling those of an orthotropic plate with relatively weak transverse bending stiffness. Conversion of bearings from nominal simple supports to nominal full ﬁxity was shown via model updating to be the principal cause of natural frequency increases of up to 50\%. The utility of the combined experimental and analytical process in direct identiﬁcation of structural properties has been proven, and the procedure can be applied to other structures and their capacity assessments.},

	abstract = {Conducting surveys of multi-storey buildings is a laborious task, because large volumes of visual and instrumental research should be carried out. Reduction of labor costs with an increase in the reliability of information about the state of damage and technical condition is an actual scientific and practical task. One of the ways to solve it is to use non-destructive vibration diagnostic methods. The purpose of carrying out diagnostics with the use of vibration based damage detection methods is to search for damages in structural elements that can cause the deviation of the dynamic parameters of a structure from calculated ones. Determination of the dynamic parameters of the structure, in particular natural frequencies and mode shapes of mechanical systems, is one of the most important tasks that allows obtaining integral information about the state of a structure. This article presents the results of calculations for the localization of slabs defects in a multi-storey building with a transverse crack, span L = 4.5 (m), height H = 0.2 (m), with prestressed reinforcement d = 0.05 (m). Vibration based Damage Index method was used to localize the defect. During the study, reliable localization values of the defect area of the slab were obtained, this indicates that the vibration method for determining the damage index with a sufficient degree of accuracy allowed predicting the site of damage to the structure.},

Vibration Based Damage Detection is attractive solution for the detection of damage and its evaluation and for that Knowledge of the modal properties is required. In this paper dynamic response of the girder is obtained in real-time to perform operational modal analysis and Time Domain Decomposition technique is used to obtain the modal frequencies [1]. Innovative approach of plotting magnitude of modal values is used to detect the presence of damage. In addition to it, the response is processed to remove noise with the help of the filter to reduce the error. Since there is absence of clear visuals from plot of modal, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for prediction of damage [2]. Singular Value Decomposition helps in getting singular using which it becomes possible to predict presence of damage clearly.},

	abstract = {Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques are among the most common approaches for structural damage identification. The presence of damage in structures may be identified by monitoring the changes in dynamic behavior subject to external loading, and is typically performed by using experimental modal analysis (EMA) or operational modal analysis (OMA). These tools for SHM normally require a limited number of physically attached transducers (e.g. accelerometers) in order to record the response of the structure for further analysis. Signal conditioners, wires, wireless receivers and a data acquisition system (DAQ) are also typical components of traditional sensing systems used in vibration-based SHM. However, instrumentation of lightweight structures with contact sensors such as accelerometers may induce mass-loading effects, and for large-scale structures, the instrumentation is labor intensive and time consuming. Achieving high spatial measurement resolution for a large-scale structure is not always feasible while working with traditional contact sensors, and there is also the potential for a lack of reliability associated with fixed contact sensors in outliving the life-span of the host structure. Among the state-of-the-art noncontact measurements, digital video cameras are able to rapidly collect high-density spatial information from structures remotely. In this paper, the subtle motions from recorded video (i.e. a sequence of images) are extracted by means of Phase-based Motion Estimation (PME) and the extracted information is used to conduct damage identification on a 2.3-meter long Skystream® wind turbine blade (WTB). The PME and phased-based motion magnification approach estimates the structural motion from the captured sequence of images for both a baseline and damaged test cases on a wind turbine blade. Operational deflection shapes of the test articles are also quantified and compared for the baseline and damaged states. In addition, having proper lighting while working with high-speed cameras can be an issue, therefore image enhancement and contrast manipulation has also been performed to enhance the raw images. Ultimately, the extracted resonant frequencies and operational deflection shapes are used to detect the presence of damage, demonstrating the feasibility of implementing non-contact video measurements to perform realistic structural damage detection.},

This assessment concerns performance of the as-built structure compared to the design and can also extend to the assessment of structural deterioration or damage. Simple validation of numerical results by dynamic testing has met some success; however, feedback from testing into analysis is usually crude, and only recently have systematic techniques been developed that can be supplied to such structures. This paper investigates the application of sensitivity-based model updating technology to the dynamic assessment of the Safti Link Bridge, a curved cable-stayed bridge in Singapore. Based on the measured modal data from prototype testing, the simulated dynamic properties obtained via ﬁniteelement analysis have been signiﬁcantly improved by modiﬁcation of uncertain structural parameters such as Young’s modulus of concrete and structural geometry.},

The FBDD method and the MBDD method are evaluated for several damage scenarios by locating and sizing damage in numerically simulated prestressed concrete beams for which two natural frequencies and mode shapes are generated from ﬁnite element models.

However, damage identiﬁcation methods of hinge joint damage are still limited. In this study, a damage identiﬁcation algorithm for simply supported hinged-slab bridges based on the modiﬁed hinge plate method (MHPM) and artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) algorithms was proposed by considering the effect of hinge damage conditions on the lateral load distribution (LLD) of structures. Firstly, MHPM was proposed and demonstrated, which is based on a traditional hinge plate method by introducing relative displacement as a damage factor to simulate hinge joint damage. The effectiveness of MHPM was veriﬁed through comparison with the ﬁnite element method (FEM). Secondly, damage identiﬁcation was treated as the inverse problem of calculating the LLD in damage conditions of simply supported slab bridges. Four ABC algorithms were chosen to solve the problem due to its simple structure, ease of implementation, and robustness. Comparisons of convergence speed and identiﬁcation accuracy with genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization were also conducted. Finally, hinged bridges composed of four and seven slabs were studied as numerical examples to account for the feasibility and correctness of the proposed method. The simulation results revealed that the proposed algorithm could identify the location and degree of damaged joints efﬁciently and precisely.},

	abstract = {A vibration-based bridge scour detection procedure using a cantilever-based piezoelectric energy harvesting device (EHD) is proposed here. This has an advantage over an accelerometer-based method in that potentially, the requirement for a power source can be negated with the only power requirement being the storage and/or transmission of the data. Ideally, this source of power could be fulﬁlled by the EHD itself, although much research is currently being done to explore this. The open-circuit EHD voltage is used here to detect bridge frequency shifts arising due to scour. Using one EHD attached to the central bridge pier, both scour at the pier of installation and scour at another bridge pier can be detected from the EHD voltage generated during the bridge free-vibration stage, while the harvester is attached to a healthy pier. The method would work best with an initial modal analysis of the bridge structure in order to identify frequencies that may be sensitive to scour. Frequency components corresponding to harmonic loading and electrical interference arising from experiments are removed using the ﬁlter bank property of singular spectrum analysis (SSA). These frequencies can then be monitored by using harvested voltage from the energy harvesting device and successfully utilised towards structural health monitoring of a model bridge aﬀected by scour.},

	abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best -known position (pbest), but is also guided toward the best -known positions (gbest) in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. The particles move in the search space with considering its own velocity and position called as pbest, but pbest has the tendency to flow around the local optima. Because of this problem we compare the different Particle swarm optimization based algorithm with its principles \& application in this paper. Variable Neighbourhood PSO, Adaptive PSO \& Niche PSO compare to see the performance of the particles in the search space with respect to time.},

To overcome the limitation of PSO, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, called hybrid PSO–EO algorithm, through introducing EO to PSO. The hybrid approach elegantly combines the exploration ability of PSO with the exploitation ability of EO. We testify the performance of the proposed approach on a suite of unimodal/multimodal benchmark functions and provide comparisons with other meta-heuristics.

	abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population-based algorithm motivated by intelligent collective behavior of some animals. The most important advantages of the PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The inertia weight (w) is one of PSO’s parameters originally proposed by Shi and Eberhart to bring about a balance between the exploration and exploitation characteristics of PSO. Since the introduction of this parameter, there have been a number of proposals of different strategies for determining the value of inertia weight during a course of run. This paper presents the ﬁrst comprehensive review of the various inertia weight strategies reported in the related literature. These approaches are classiﬁed and discussed in three main groups: constant, time-varying and adaptive inertia weights. A new adaptive inertia weight approach is also proposed which uses the success rate of the swarm as its feedback parameter to ascertain the particles’ situation in the search space. The empirical studies on ﬁfteen static test problems, a dynamic function and a real world engineering problem show that the proposed particle swarm optimization model is quite effective in adapting the value of w in the dynamic and static environments.},

The proposed technique is integrated with comprehensive learning strategy to explore the solution effectively. The performance comparison is carried out against different high quality PSO variants on the set of standard benchmark functions with and without coordinate rotation and with asymmetric initialization. Proposed ILPSO algorithm is efﬁcient in terms of convergence rate, solution accuracy, standard deviation, and computation time compared with other PSO variants.

	abstract = {In order to enforce particles to search inside the solution space of interest during the optimization procedure, various boundary conditions are currently used in particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. The performances, however, vary considerably with the dimensionality of the problem and the location of the global optimum in the solution space. In this paper, different boundary conditions are categorized into two groups, namely, restricted and unrestricted, according to whether the errant particles are relocated inside the allowable solution space or not. Moreover, efforts are made to explore different hybrid unrestricted boundary conditions by introducing the favorable characteristics of the reﬂecting and damping boundary conditions into the existing invisible boundary condition. The performances of the boundary conditions are tested based on both mathematical benchmark functions and a real-world electromagnetic problem: the optimization of a 2-D 16-element array antenna. Simulation results are examined from both the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the algorithm. Comparisons show that the unrestricted boundary conditions are more efﬁcient when the global optimum is inside the boundary of the solution space, and the damping boundary condition is more robust and consistent when the global optimum is close to the boundary.},

The idea is to accurately read the inherent drawbacks of existing immune algorithms (IAs) and propose new techniques to resolve them. The basic features of IAs dealt in this paper are: hypermutation mechanism, clonal expansion, immune memory and several other features related to initialization and selection of candidate solution present in a population set. Dealing with the above-mentioned features we have proposed a fast clonal algorithm (FCA) incorporating a parallel mutation operator comprising of Gaussian and Cauchy mutation strategy. In addition, a new concept has been proposed for initialization, selection and clonal expansion process. The concept of existing immune memory has also been modiﬁed by using the elitist mechanism. Finally, to test the efﬁcacy of proposed algorithm in terms of search quality, computational cost, robustness and efﬁciency, quantitative analyses have been performed in this paper. In addition, empirical analyses have been executed to prove the superiority of proposed strategies. To demonstrate the applicability of proposed algorithm over real-world problems, Machineloading problem of ﬂexible manufacturing system (FMS) is worked out and matched with the results present in literature.},

To save the best solutions, the method of copying particles and their storage strategy in the database are used.

Driven from the fact that aesthetic design goals are not easily quantifiable, key elements are introduced and implemented herein towards an interactive framework for algorithmic design of truss structures. Within this framework, the user can visually assess interesting solutions, save them for later assessment, actively drive the optimization towards individual aims, re-initialize the optimization with a set of available solutions, or restart the design process. A criterion is introduced as a means of quantifying subjective goals, expressing the similarity of the shape of candidate solutions with respect to reference designs. The framework is tested on a benchmark case and then applied to the design of a truss tower. The effectiveness of the similarity criteria, as well as the ability of the user to drive the process towards specific design goals is demonstrated.},

The method inherits the main advantage of the IGA-based shape optimization, i.e., the control points are used as design variables, thus the design model, analysis model and optimization model are uniformly described with the NURBS, providing easy communication between the three models and resulting in a smooth optimized boundary. However, the main feature of the proposed method is the use of PSO, which provides an attractive gradient-free alternative to complicated sensitivity analysis.

This paper proposes a parameter optimization method for dynamic vibration absorbers and seeks parameters of a dynamic vibration absorber with better vibration suppression performance. Firstly, the frequency response function of the dynamic vibration absorber-rotor coupling system is obtained by using the finite element method. Then, basing on the optimal mathematical model, the optimal design variables are solved with the adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm. Also, an example is used to prove the validity of the optimization design method mentioned in this paper. Further, in order to master the influence of deviation from the optimal value on the suppressing vibration effect, the vibration suppression performance changes of the dynamic vibration absorber whose parameters deviate from the optimal value are analyzed. The results show that: compared with conventional design method, this method is more superior; The dynamic vibration absorber with optimal parameters has better vibration suppression performance; At the same degree deviated from the optimal value, the stiffness has a more remarkable influence on the vibration suppression performance than damping for suppressing the first resonance; For the dynamic vibration absorber which is adopted to suppress the fixed-frequency vibration, the influence of stiffness deviation on the vibration suppression performance appears an obvious interval which is related to working speed.},

The Nam O Railway Bridge is a large-scale steel truss bridge located on the unique main rail track from the north to the south of Vietnam. An extensive vibration measurement campaign and model updating are extremely necessary to build a reliable model for health condition assessment and operational safety management of the bridge. The experimental measurements are carried out under ambient vibrations using piezoelectric sensors, and a ﬁnite element (FE) model is created in MATLAB to represent the physical behavior of the structure. By model updating, the discrepancies between the experimental and the numerical results are minimized. For the success of the model updating, the efﬁciency of the optimization algorithm is essential. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) are employed to update the unknown model parameters. The result shows that PSO not only provides a better accuracy between the numerical model and measurements, but also reduces the computational cost compared to GA. This study focuses on the stiffness conditions of typical joints of truss structures. According to the results, the assumption of semi-rigid joints (using rotational springs) can most accurately represent the dynamic characteristics of the truss bridge considered.},

	abstract = {With the advent of big data era, complex optimization problems with many objectives and large numbers of decision variables are constantly emerging. Traditional research about multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) focuses on multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) with small numbers of variables and less than four objectives. At present, MOPs with large numbers of variables and many objectives (greater than or equal to four) are constantly emerging. When tackling this type of MOPs, the traditional multi-objective PSO algorithms have low efﬁciency. Aiming at these multi-objective large-scale optimization problems (MOLSOPs) and many-objective large-scale optimization problems (MaOLSOPs), we need to explore thoroughly parallel attributes of the particle swarm, and design the novel PSO algorithms according to the characteristics of distributed parallel computation. We survey the related research on PSO: multi-objective large-scale optimization, many-objective optimization, and distributed parallelism. Based on the aforementioned three aspects, the multi-objective large-scale distributed parallel PSO and many-objective large-scale distributed parallel PSO methodologies are proposed and discussed, and the other future research trends are also illuminated.},

	abstract = {Due to the expanding system scale and increasing operational complexity, the cascade hydropower reservoir operation balancing beneﬁt and ﬁrm output is becoming one of the most important problems in China’s hydropower system. To handle this problem, this paper presents a parallel multi-objective particle swarm optimization where the swarm with large population size is divided into several smaller subswarms to be simultaneously optimized by different worker threads. In each subtask, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization is adopted to ﬁnish the entire evolutionary process, where the leader particles, external archive set and computational parameters are all dynamically updated. Besides, a novel constraint handling strategy is used to identify the feasible search space while the domination strategy based on constraint violation is used to enhance the convergence speed of swarm. The presented method is applied to Lancang cascade hydropower system in southwest China. The results show that PMOPSO can provide satisfying scheduling results in different cases. For the variation coefﬁcient of generation in 30 independent runs, the presented method can bettered the serial algorithm with about 66.67\% and 61.29\% reductions in normal and dry years, respectively. Hence, this paper provides an effective tool for multi-objective operation of cascade hydropower system.},

	abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic whose performance deteriorates signiﬁcantly when utilized on optimization problems subject to noise. On these problems, particles eventually fail to distinguish good from bad solutions because their objective values are corrupted by noise. Speciﬁcally, the effect of noise causes particles to suffer from deception when they do not select their true neighborhood best solutions, from blindness when they ignore better solutions, and from disorientation when they prefer worse solutions. Resampling methods reduce the presence of these conditions by re-evaluating the solutions multiple times and better estimating their true objective values with a sample mean over the evaluations. PSO with Equal Resampling (PSO-ER) ﬁnds better solutions than the regular PSO thanks mainly to the reduction of deception and blindness, as has been found by utilizing a set of population statistics that track the presence of these conditions throughout the search process. However, the solutions of PSO-ER have been reported to be worse than those of state-of-the-art resampling-based PSO algorithms, and the underlying reasons are not known because the population statistics for such algorithms have never been computed. In this article, we study the population statistics for a new extension to PSO-ER that further reduces the presence of blindness, and for state-ofthe-art resampling-based PSO algorithms. Experiments on 20 large-scale benchmark functions subject to different levels of noise show that our new algorithm succeeds at reducing blindness and ﬁnding better solutions than PSO-ER. However, the population statistics for state-of-the-art resampling-based PSO algorithms show that their particles suffer even less from deception, blindness and disorientation, and therefore ﬁnd much better solutions.},

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary algorithm inspired by animal social behaviour. PSO achieves performance by iteratively directing its particles toward the optimum using its social and cognitive components. Various modifications have been applied to PSO focusing on addressing a variety of methods for adjusting PSO's parameters (i.e., parameter adjustment), social interaction of the particles (i.e., neighbourhood topology) and ways to address the search objectives (i.e., sub-swarm topology). The PSO approach can easily fit in different search optimization categories such as Self Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Stochastic Search, Population- based, and Behaviour-based Search. This study addresses these principal aspects of PSO. In addition, conventional and Basic PSO are introduced and their shortcomings are discussed. Later on, various suggestions and modifications proposed by literature are introduced and discussed.},

	abstract = {A modal-based global method for identiﬁcation, localization and quantiﬁcation of damage of a shear frame structure is presented in this paper. The method involves identiﬁcation of modal parameters from the vibration responses of the structure only (output only) using a combination of natural excitation technique (NExT) and eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), and determination of stiffness parameters using very few identiﬁed modes by employing a least squares solution procedure. Finally, damage is indicated by comparing the stiffnesses of the (possibly) damaged structure with that of the undamaged structure. The implementation of NExT–ERA requires a reference channel for modal identiﬁcation, but several limitations of using a single reference channel have been identiﬁed from the investigations of this study. To overcome the limitations, a new approach called multi-reference-based mode selection is proposed in this paper. The approach makes use of all the available DOFs, but one at a time, as reference channels and identiﬁes the best representative modes of the structure by a mode screening process and a mode separation process. The approach is also automated for expediency and possible real-time application. The presented damage detection methodology is implemented on the analytical phase I and experimental phase II of the IASC-ASCE SHM benchmark problem and shows an accuracy of around 90\% in damage detection.

In the proposed modal identification method, damping ratio, consistent mode indicator from observability matrices (CMI\_O) and modal amplitude coherence (MAC) are used as criteria to distinguish the physically true modes from spurious modes. Enhanced frequency domain decomposition (EFDD), the data-driven stochastic subspace identification method (SSI-DATA) and the proposed method are respectively applied to extract the modal parameters of the Canton Tower under different environmental conditions. Results of modal parameter identification based on output-only measurements are presented and discussed. User-selected parameters used in those methods are suggested and discussed.

The exercise had several purposes that included the evaluation of the current technology for instrumentation and system identification and the generation of an experimental dataset of modal properties to be used for validation and updating of finite element models for scenario simulation and structural health monitoring. The exercise was conducted as part of a project aimed at developing online diagnosis capabilities for three landmark European suspension bridges.},
